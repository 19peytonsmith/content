            <div type="article">
                <head>The Situation</head>
                <p> The telegrams both from St. Petersburg and Tokio show that the battle has by no
                    means ended, and that the theatre of the great fight has merely been moved from
                    Mukden to the north of Tieling, where another furios struggle is proceeding.
                    Kuropatkin proved his genius for retreat both at Liao-yang and at the Sha-ho,
                    but he has not shown that he can make use of the greatest opportunity for the
                    display of that genius that the war has yet</p>
                <cols n="6"/>
                <cb n="6"/>
                <p>given him. For eighteen days this stupendous battle has been raging and roaring
                    in Man-churia. For eighteen days the Japanese armies have been patiently and
                    relentlessly pushing forward to the consummation of a careful plan, for eighteen
                    days the Russian forces have been obstinately contesting every inch of hard won
                    ground with the dogged and obstinate cou-rage of men who do not recognise
                    defeat. If Kuropatkin suceeds once more in ex-tricating any considerable part of
                    his army and impedimenta from the battle now raging north of Tieling, the end
                    will not have been attained, and the terrible sacrifice will not have secured
                    the object for which so a high a price has been paid. That even-tuality seems
                    more and more improbable. To all seeming this must be of the campaign whether
                    Kuropatkin capitulates, or breaks through with a handful, a remnant, of his once
                    great and powerful army. But if he succeeds in pushing direct northwards from
                    Tieling, as he pushed on last week aganist terrific odds from Mukden to Tieling
                    he will have accomplished a feat surpassing in skill any yet achieved by a
                    beaton general.</p>
                <p>A telegram, despatched from Tokio yester-day, announces that the Japanese
                    occupied Sing-king on the 13th inst. Sing-king, like Fu-shun, is a small town
                    with a wall a third of a mile long surrounding it. Sing-king's height above the
                    sea is fourteen hundred feet, and this will afford an idea of the fall of the
                    country towards Mukden. To reach Sing-king from the Yalu, as he new Ja-panese
                    Army has done, the Chang-chung-ling, or Serpent Pass, eighteen miles to the
                    south-west, has to be traversed, where the height is 2,300ft above sea level, it
                    being the highest point on the road from Sing-king to Liao-yang. On the north
                    side of this pass rises the Shu-tsu (which joins the Hun-ho at Ying-pan), and on
                    the south side the Tai-tse-sho. The difficulties attending the passage of an
                    army through very hilly country are not few even under normal conditions, and it
                    will be easy to com-prehend that the hopes which the Russians entertain of being
                    able to conduct the strate-gies retirement of their left successfully through
                    such a region, with the Japanese close on heels and on both flanks as well, must
                    be sl indeed. The Japanese army which has occ Sing-king consists of more than
                    six sions of territorial troops under. General Kawamura, and this magnificent
                    force, which by this time may have reached Ying Pan will afford a further line
                    of resistance to any attempt of the remnants of Linievitch's army to retire on
                    the East, assuming that army is still existing as a military entity, which is
                    doubtful.</p>
                <p>Our telegrams contain the important news that a Japanese fleet left Singapore for
                    an unknown destination, but it is believed that it is ready to cross the Indian
                    Ocean. This fleet consists of 22 men-of-war. Meanwhile, Rodjestvensky's Baltic
                    Fleet has gone to Djibouti to meet the third Squadron, which is due to pass
                    through the Suez Canal next week. It must be remembered that, in spite of her
                    wonderful achievements, Japan still depends for her success upon her retention
                    of the command of the sea. That command, once it passes to Russia, will
                    ultimatley render almost fruitless the whole of the japanese victories on land.
                    Her island kingdom will no longer form as at present an impregnable base from
                    which to supply her armies in Manchuria, nor with her still relatively small
                    fleet has she the reserves upon which to fall back in the event of an exhaustive
                    or indecisive naval battle with the Baltic Fleet. In short, a "stale-mate" would
                    in present circumstances go far to neutralise the successes she has hiterto won.
                    The departure therefore of the fleet from Singapore shows that the Japanese hold
                    that no settles peace is in sight until the Russian Navy as well as the Army, is
                    distinctly and undoubtedly worsted in the fight</p>

                                <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its
                                    subscribers the accompanying description of some of the many
                                    interesting routes by which they may travel homewards. Great
                                    care has been taken to arrange them as accurately and concisely
                                    as possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught
                                    with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                                    things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference
                                    in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you may
                                    arrive in Europe.This depends partly upon the month in which you
                                    leave Egypt, for Cairo in January may be a little warmer than
                                    the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in March it
                                    will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                                    other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                                    the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect.
                                    The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and
                                    Southern Spain. Venice and the district (although they have many
                                    attractions) are not uniformly warm until much later. Florence
                                    is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes there are
                                    cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                                <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to
                                    be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the
                                    time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                                    the Continent of Europe.</p>
                                <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                                <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                                    Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The
                                    short ones are as follows:—</p>

                                <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and
                                    Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British
                                    India, and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their steamers
                                    are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                                <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                                    Alexandria, without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can
                                    now be made without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                                <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni,
                                    Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to
                                    Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good steamers from
                                    Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive but quickest through
                                    Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port
                                    Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                                    Alexandria.</p>
                                <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very
                                    little luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but
                                    there are several good and responsible forwarding agents in
                                    Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to deliver packages to any
                                    address in Europe.</p>
                                <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is
                                    undoubtedly by the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to
                                    Brindisi. One of these leaves port Said every week, as soon as
                                    possible after receiving the Indian mails from the great liner
                                    arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                                    enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of
                                    speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially
                                    built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If
                                    you are going straight through to England you will find the
                                    train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                                    changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating
                                    on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                                    leaving Port Said.</p>

                                <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if
                                    you elect to go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait
                                    at Brindisi some time for your train. At Brindisi there is
                                    nothing to see except the place which is supposed to have been
                                    the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                                <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be
                                    broken at Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                                <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the
                                    first city of Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting
                                    history, and remains of fine buildings - theatre, temple, circus
                                    and aqueduct - tell of its importance. Its situation is the most
                                    picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on the gulf, the
                                    entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                                    seven arches.</p>
                                <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places
                                    in Southern Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the
                                    ruins of its Norman castle, giving a most imposing appearance to
                                    the place. The cathedral contains some very fine marble, and an
                                    11th century Byzantine bronze door. Salerno was at one time a
                                    seat of learning, its medical school being famous ; the
                                    university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful
                                    Greek temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The
                                    travertine walls, the gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres,
                                    and the Basilica are of surpassing interest and the place is a
                                    happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                                <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed
                                    to Rome, whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and
                                    the Italian Lakes; then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne,
                                    Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by the coast, by Civita Vecchia
                                    and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the Mont Cenis
                                    route.</p>

                                <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co.’s
                                    steamers which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA. </p>
                                <p>From Messina the railway runs along the north coast of Sicily to
                                    Palermo and down the east coast to Syracuse via Taormina and
                                    Catania. TAORMINA is one of the most charming and popular places
                                    on the island. Giardini is the station at which to alight, and
                                    the drive up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one
                                    hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag fashion, and
                                    charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                                    unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and
                                    visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the
                                    Roamns. Catania is the starting place for the ascent of Etna,
                                    beyond that there is little of interest to the visitor. The
                                    Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the
                                    island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are at
                                    Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places
                                    are well worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history,
                                    having been a Greek city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in
                                    B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes
                                    was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an
                                    ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso an
                                    amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great
                                    temple dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill
                                    900 feet high and commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins
                                    of Agrigentum are most interesting - of the timeple to juno
                                    there are still many columns stnading. There are also the
                                    remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                                    enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with
                                    about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and
                                    enjoys a delightful climate Much of interest is to be found in
                                    this fine city. The Palazzo Reale of Saracenic origin and close
                                    to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its
                                    picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                                    Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit.
                                    Excursions from Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the
                                    beautiful Cloisters, and to Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also
                                    the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte. With its lovely scenery
                                    and delightful climate, its antiquities and beautiful
                                    vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in
                                    the Mediterranean.</p>

                                <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio
                                    Rubattino Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach
                                    Naples or leave it without wishing to explore some of its
                                    islands, besides the lovely places on its bay — Castellamare and
                                    Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [or you
                                    can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island
                                    is full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of
                                    which on a fine day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating
                                    occupation. The colour of the water is a perpetual joy, and the
                                    caves seem to be a veritable trap for sunshine. Of flowers and
                                    ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be visited in
                                    another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The
                                    steamers start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of
                                    Posilipo, Pozzuoli and Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little
                                    volcanic island of Procida is chiefly inhabited by sailors. The
                                    island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort, with mineral
                                    waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle on
                                    a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at
                                    which you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of
                                    Mount Epomeus for a glorious view.</p>
                                <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who
                                    can will devote at least one week to visiting the many
                                    historical and interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose
                                    charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                                <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of
                                    five hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well
                                    be spent admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding
                                    country. In Florence itself the churches and galleries are of
                                    absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions
                                    should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                                    fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli,
                                    one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes
                                    winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                                    delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa,
                                    with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made
                                    first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by
                                    cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                                    takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                                    view.</p>

                                    a list of the principal attractions may not be out of place : -
                                    St. Peter's, the Vatican, Capitol and National Museums, Gallery
                                    of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran

                                    should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                                    fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli,
                                    one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes
                                    winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                                    delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa,
                                    with the Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made
                                    first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by
                                    cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                                    takes about an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                                    view.</p>
                                <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either
                                    by Pistoja and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old
                                    fortified towns of Italy, with an imposing wall built round it,
                                    and massive gates leading into the town. Here is also the fine
                                    old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a fine Cathedral
                                    and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                                    possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                                    at sunset. From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you
                                    can take boat to Genoa and thence to the Riviera or Milan and
                                    The Lakes.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). -The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest deathaverages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature —warm in winter and | deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and his-torical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>Genoa is the principal port on the Mediter-­ranean, and the first commercial
                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook’s offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest

                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                    <head>Route IV. Greece and the Ionian Isles. Constantinople</head>
                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>

                <div type="article">
                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
