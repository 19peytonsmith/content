                    <p>THE GREATEST care should be taken in what we eat and drink, yet we are too
                        often indifferent and careless, notwithstanding health depends on what we
                        eat and drink</p>
                    <p>In regard to drink nothing but the best should be taken. It costs no more
                        than the indifferent quality, if people would only ask for what they know is
                        the best Old Scotch Whisky is the most wholesome beverage yet known Mackie's
                        Scotch Whisky gives an undoubted guarantee to those who are not judges of
                        quality.</p>

                    <p>I hereby certify that I have taken samples of every vatting of Mackie's White
                        Horse Cellar Blend of Scotch Whisky used in bottling during the month of
                        September, and the results of my analyses indicate that it conforms to the
                        standard for Pot Still Scotch Whisky set up in the London case. I am also of
                        opinion that it is an old Whisky of excellent quality and flavour, which has
                        been well matured in wood.</p>

                    <p>SCENES FROM AL JABARTI.</p>
                    <p>Since the leaders of the Egyptian Nationalist party are never tired of
                        insisting that the sufferings of Egypt in the past have been grossly and
                        wittingly exaggerated by the partisans of the British Occupation, the critic
                        who is ignorant of Egyptian history is faced by a difficulty, viz, that he
                        has little information on which to base any reply he may wish to make to the
                        ‘patriotic’ “laudator temporis acti.” For the reign of Ismail Pasha
                        documents exist, but what if the champions of the Nation alist idea declare
                        that Ismail’s rule was something exceptional and that if would he in the
                        highest degree unfair to take the oppression and injustice that marked the
                        latter days of that ruler as being the normal feature of Egyptian history
                        during the past century? But there is evidence, and evidence of a very
                        remarkable nature concerning the sufferings of the Egyptians in earlier
                        days, and among the witnesses we shall cite the talented Sheikh Abderrahman
                        Al Jabarti, the only great Egyptian author of the past century, a Moslem and
                        something of a scholar, neither an ‘intrus’ nor xenophobe—indeed a very
                        credit able example of a pious and conservative Moslem. For the edification
                        of our readers and the benefit of the critics above-mentioned, we purpose to
                        give certain extracts from Al Jabarti's VIIth volume, wherein the good
                        Sheikh describes the great events that followed the withdrawal of the French
                        from Egypt and the return of the Turkish armies under the command of the
                        Vizier Yusuf Pasha, We will begin with the 20th day of the month Saffar
                        A.II. 1260. On that day Turkish soldiers, horsemen and footmen, reached the
                        city of Cairo and the Grand Vizier pitched his camp at Shubra. The French
                        garrison under General Belliard—unable to risk further action against the
                        combined force of the English, the Turks and the Mamelukes — made honourable
                        terms for itself. The negotiations were rapidly completed and on Thursday,
                        the 30th of the month, the French retired from the capital while the Osmanli
                        soldiers entered first through a breach in the walls and later through the
                        Bah el Nasr. Great was the exultation of the inhabitants as the new-comers
                        marched through the streets. Men and boys cried “Allah yinsar el
                        Sultan”—’God give victory to the Sultan and the women uttered the
                        ‘zaghareet’ from the windows. The redoubtable janissaries piled their arms
                        and placed their ensigns before the cafes, the shops and the baths, while
                        Yusif Pasha, accompanied by agas and soldiers, rode to the Mosque of Hussein
                        and gave thanks for victory. Then the Osmauli General paid a brief visit, to
                        the Sheikh el Sadat, examined the Masque of Al Azhar, where he gave largesse
                        to the ferrashes and the servants, and returned to his camp. Meanwhile the
                        janissaries trooped into the town amid the cheers of the populace; but the
                        merchant and shopkeepers, before whose establishments the soldiers piled
                        their muskets, regarded these wild warriors with some concern and in the
                        afternoon the allies of the Egyptians obliged the townspeople to furnish
                        them with rations, water, “and even coffee” according to our author. Next
                        day "Kaba Kol” the leader of the janissaries :—whose strange name suggests
                        some wild Tartar from the interior of Asia Minor—ordered his men to take
                        down the banners that had been planted before the shops and the merchants
                        had a temporary respite. On Sunday, the first day of the month Rabi el Awal,
                        the grand Aga of the janissaries, rode through the streets and on the
                        following day another potent dignitary, Hassein the Kapitan Pasha, reached
                        Gizeh. Thence he repaired to the mosque of Sheikh Hussein where he
                        sacrificed five buffaloes and seven sheep and laid four Persian shawls on
                        the Sheikh's tomb. But while the Osmanli notables behaved as victorious
                        notables should behave, the army was showing signs of a certain lack of
                        discipline. In the Gamalieh quarter a thirsty him, hade him pay the money
                        and reprimanding him severely, called for the bastinado. But the Arnaout so
                        far from submitting to the penalty drew his pistol from his sash and laid
                        the Aga low, and hastening to his house maintained an accurate fire on all
                        who approached to arrest him. Five persons had fallen when two of his fellow
                        countrymen passed by; the janissaries seeing a foe in every mountaineer slew
                        them both and when their attack on the house proved costly and useless, set
                        fire to it The soldier broke out but was overpowered and executed and thus,
                        “nine persons perished for a few drops of liquorice water." But these
                        incidents were forgotten by the populace in the joy of the solemn and
                        triumphal entry of the armies of the Khalif. On the fifth of the month the
                        vanguard of the Osmanli army passed through the Bab el Nasr and from dawn to
                        midday the great host marched through the streets. The Albanian hillmen, the
                        Mameluke Emirs, the Turks, the Syrian infantry, the janissaries and the
                        marines, great officers of the Empire, Ibrahim Pasha the wali of Aleppo,
                        Hamed Pasha wali of Egypt, the Katkhoda of the Empire, Jibji Pasha Toussoun,
                        the Cadi of the army and his naibs, the ulema and the orders of dervishes
                        marched past to the sound of drums and horns, and behind them rode the
                        Vizier Yussef Pasha clothed in blue pelisse embroidered with gold and lined
                        with martens fur, and wearing a white aigrette adorned with diamonds ;
                        behind him walked two of his followers who cast largesse—silver coins minted
                        at Stamboul among the crowd. What wonder that Al Jabarti wrote on that
                        day—“Praise and glory to God who has granted us this blessing.” The next few
                        days passed happily, but on the 18th of the month the Vizier deprived the
                        Grand Cadi of his office on account of “his revolting avarice”. On the 24th
                        came a tragedy. The daughter of Sheikh El Bakri, accused of misconduct with
                        a Frenchman was arrested, a shameful breach of the 13th article of the
                        Convention signed by the Turks, British and French. Her professions of
                        repentance were in vain. Her father disavowed her and her head was struck
                        from her shoulders. Another erring lady was strangled by her husband with
                        the permission of the Grand Vizier. Now, too, the troops began to rob right
                        and left and those quartered in the Christian kisms charged their hosts
                        double as much as they demanded trom the Moslems for food, pocket money and
                        Turkish baths. On the third day of the next month orders were given to treat
                        Christians and Jews with humanity and on the 14th the town criers informed
                        Cairo that all who believed in a Holy Book were guaranteed peace and
                        security—if they would pay a small contribution equal to four years’
                        taxation to their rulers. But these contributions did not find their way to
                        the pockets of the army. As in the Yemen today, so in Egypt more than a
                        century ago, the Ottoman troops were unpaid and looting and violence on
                        their part grew more and more frequent. Cruel and unjustifiable executions,
                        forced loans, and attacks on peace able citizens became the order of the
                        day. “A soldier would sit down in,a shop and the, would arise and swear that
                        his purse had been stolen and lay hands on whatever he could take to
                        indemnify himself. The troops, moreover, compelled the people to give them
                        good coins in exchange for counterfeit pieces They insulted women in the
                        streets in shameless fashion and in the villages they committed every sort
                        of excess. When they entered any village they would produce a paper on which
                        Turkish words were written, and would tell the fellaheen that they had come
                        to make an end of tyranny or any other invention that come into their
                        travelling expenses after which they would arrest the Sheikhs and e.xtort
                        large contributions from them Consequently most of the Egyptian—especially
                        of the fellaheen regretted the days of the French occupation.” While their
                        deliverers played these prank near Cairo the leading Egyptian Emir, the
                        Mameluke Al Alfi, gave the Saides cause for complaint. On hearing of the
                        death of any person, this ingenious financier would seize the rightful heirs
                        and by beating and imprisoning them seldom failed to persuade these
                        unfortunates to make him sole legatee His agents terrified women and
                        children and carried houses by storm in such fashion that the Saides,
                        preferring the intermittent ferocity of the Turks to the constant oppression
                        of the Emir, repaired to Cairo where they thronged the streets and the
                        gardens and lived by theft, or from the alms of the charitably disposed."
                        Such was the condition of Egypt three months after its delivery from the
                        French occupation Absit omen !</p>

                    <p>MR. JAMES INTERVIEWED.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>As there have been a very large number of conflicting and unauthorised
                        statements in the Press on this subject the “Egyptian Gazette”
                        representative made a point of interviewing Mr. Carkeet James at the Public
                        Works office yesterday. . '</p>
                    <p>Our representative gathered that all that has hitherto been published is
                        entirely erroneous, and, as a matter of fact nothing whatever has been
                        definitely decided; nor has any official communication been made on the
                        subject of the drainage scheme of’ the capital.</p>
                    <p>In brief the actual situation is as follows Of nine schemes submitted, one
                        has been selected and the Adviser fo the Ministry of Public Works Sir
                        William Garstin, is at present engaged in preparing his note on the scheme
                        before presenting it to the Council or Ministers.</p>
                    <p>This is a very bald announcement, but it is all that is justified at the
                        present moment. The amount of work entailed in arriving at this stage only
                        must have been stupendous, including, as it has «lone, a most minute and
                        systematic examination of the city and an enormous amount of work making
                        plans and designs. All this work has been beset with difficulties, not the
                        least of which has been the lack of good draughtsmen. One by one all
                        obstacles have been overcome, however, and in a very short time the
                        perfected scheme will be made public.</p>
                    <p>It is already generally known that Mr. Carkeet James was for eighteen years
                        in India, from whence he was called to tackle the vital question of Cairo
                        drainage. Mr. James has already accumulated a large staff of draughtsmen the
                        most important factors - and a band of assistants, animated with the same
                        energy as their chief, not to mention a large sense of courtesy not always
                        met with in Government Departments.</p>
                    <p>We give very full particulars on this subject so soon as the scheme shall
                        have been approved by the Council of Ministers.</p>

                    <head>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.</head>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>Some incontrovertible figures are at hand to show how purely local is the
                        present financial crisis, which is only confined to Alexandria and Cairo.
                        For example the receipts of the Egyptian Railway Administration are lose on
                        twenty per cent higher than they were last year. The receipts of the Delta
                        Light Railways are also a good indication of the prosperous state of the
                        country. Up to date the receipts of this company are twenty-five per cent
                        higher than for the corresponding period last year. The receipts of the
                        Egyptian. Markets are very satisfactory and every things tends to show that
                        the prosperity of the country was never at a higher level. The same tale is
                        told of all the other companies whose operations lie in the villages. The
                        fellaheen have not been affected in the slightest degree by the present
                        slump.</p>

                    <p>We do no hold ourselves responsible for the opinions expressed by our
                        correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play to all, to
                        permit-within certain necessary limits— free discussion:</p>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—I have read with interest the letter from “Anxious Observer”
                        published in your issue of the 18th inst. In discussing the question of a
                        large Cromer Memorial Tuberculosis Hospital with various friends well
                        acquainted with tips country, I find that practically all agree that there
                        are many great objections to such a scheme.</p>
                    <p>To begin with, any one who knows the native mind will at once confirm the
                        statement that if intended to benefit them, the money will be practically
                        wasted. They will not go into a home or hospital of this sort, and as far as
                        they are concerned, it would undoubtedly be another</p>
                    <p>case of “wasted effort.”</p>
                    <p>The idea is not popular, as far as I can discover, among any class of the
                        community, and it is very difficult to imagine whom it is going to benefit?
                        especially as, I believe, a similar undertaking on a modest scale is already
                        being developed, and has reached a stage which renders its final
                        accomplishment probable. This, I understand, is ample to meet any possible
                        demand.</p>
                    <p>The vast and increasing need of a Maternity Home, however, must be patent to
                        all. The small institution, which has been quietly doing what good work was
                        possible in this line for some years, is cramped for funds, and only in a
                        position to touch the fringe of the demand.</p>
                    <p>If absorbed into a large scheme of a “Cromer International Maternity Home,”
                        its sphere of usefulness would be indefinitely enlarged, and any one helping
                        the work would feel that they were assisting to fulfill Lord and Lady
                        Cromer’s farewell wishes, as set forth in the former’s valedictory
                        address.</p>
                    <p>Given the necessary support, a suitable building, worthy of the. name it
                        would bear, could be erected on some suitable spot in Alexandria, and there
                        is no reason to doubt that it would prove a lasting blessing to the classes
                        (native and European alike), who are unable, in those times of trouble, to
                        obtain the assistance, of which they stand in need</p>
                    <p>The présent home has already a sum of £2,000, raised by voluntary
                        contributions, which could doubtless be made available, with the donors’
                        consent, as a nucleus for the larger scheme, and the increased publicity
                        which would be obtained, would doubtless attract the annual subscriptions of
                        many who know nothing of the present modest little charity.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, whilst apologizing for troubling you at such length, may I ask
                        you to offer the hospitality of your columns for the expression of the
                        opinions of others on this subject, And if a sufficient response should be
                        received, it would be easy to carry the matter a stage further in due
                        course.—Your faithfully,</p>

                    <head>THE CHATHAM ACCIDENT.</head>
                    <p>CLAN CUMMING'S LIABILITIES</p>
                    <p> In the Admiralty Court last week Mr. Justice Bucknill had before him an
                        Action brought by the owners of the steamship Clan Cumming (of the Clan
                        Line) to limit their liability in respect of damages arising out of the
                        collision between the Clan Cumming and the London steamship Chatham in the
                        Suez Canal on September 5, 1905. As a result of the impact the Chatham took
                        fire, and she was sunk, it being feared that the flames would reach her
                        cargo of explosives. In consequence of tho hindrance to traffic in the
                        channel she was subsequently blown up by order of the Canal authorities. The
                        owners of the Chatham brought a claim for damages against the owners of the
                        Clan Cumming, and there was a counter-claim, each party alleging negligence
                        on the other side. The case was heard before the President (Sir Gorell
                        Barnes) who held that the Clan Cumming was alone to blame for the collision
                        This decision wan subsequently confirmed by the Court of Appeal There was no
                        loss of life or personal injury as the result of the collision. The owners
                        of the Clan Cumming feared, that the claims against thorn in respect of loss
                        of ship and goods would exceed their statutory liability of £8 per ten on
                        the gross registered tonnage (after deduction for crew space) of the Clan
                        Cumming. They therefore brought this action to limit their liability; and
                        they offered to pay into court the sum of £37,533 10s. (being the aggregate
                        of £8 per ton), together with interest at the rate of 4 per cent, from the
                        date of the collision His Lordship made tho usual decree, limiting the
                        plaintiffs’ liability as prayed.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH CONSULS IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>THEIR COMMERICAL EXPERIENCE</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>Mr. J. Robertson asked the Secretary for Foreign Affairs last Tuesday whether
                        any of the British Consuls in Egypt had been appointed to such posts by
                        reason of their commercial and industrial experience ; and whether, if not,
                        he would, in order to assist British subjects in meeting the severe and
                        increasing competition in that country, replace the present Consuls by
                        others possessing the requisite experience, or, alternatively, would appoint
                        commercial and industrial experts to British Consulates in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey ; There are two British Consuls, one with the local, the other
                        with the per sonal, rank of Consul-General, in Egypt, apart from Sir Eldon
                        Gorst. Both of these Consuls are officers of long and thorough experience in
                        all the duties, including the commercial duties discharged by their service
                        in Oriental countries, and no reflection has been cast upon their present
                        posts, which they have held for some years. There is; therefore, no reason
                        for making any change at present of Consular officers in Egypt. There are,
                        in addition, two Vice Consuls in Egypt. Consular posts in Egypt are usually
                        filled from the Levant service, entrance to which is obtained by open
                        competition. With regard to the suggestion that commercial and industrial
                        experts should be chosen outside the service, I must point out that there is
                        no more reason for doing this as regards Egypt than there is in the case of
                        other industrial countries. The best we can do is to get men who have some
                        commericial knowledge to enter for the Consular service, to give them some
                        training at the Board of Trade before beginning their duties abroad, and to
                        encourage the study of commercial matters afterwards.</p>

                    <p>There have just been placed on exhibition in the Egyptian galleries of the
                        British Museum a select few of the Egyptian inscriptions recently discovered
                        in the Sinaitic peninsula. One of the most interesting is a sandstone stele
                        and altar set up by Sebek-her-heb, an overseer of the Royal apartments, and
                        a subordinate official named Kemen, who were attached to the Royal Chancery.
                        The tablet, which is dated in the forty-fourth year of Amenem hat III, about
                        B. C. 2300, is of red sandstone, and contains an inscription in which a
                        prayer is offered to Athor, the “ lady of the turquoise land, ” by which
                        name the Sinaitic peninsula was known to the Ancient Egyptians. There is
                        also the lower portion of a statue of Usertesen II., B. C. 2333, dedicated
                        to Hathor by the King’s officials stationed in Sinai, and the lower portion
                        of a seated figure of Hathor, dedicated to the goddess by Senefru, a captain
                        of the boats in the reign of Amen-em hat I. The objects were discovered at
                        Serabit-el-Kadim, in the Sinaitic peninsula, and were presented to the
                        British Museum by the Egypt Exploration Fund. </p>
