                    <p>St. Petersburg, November 6. News of continual anti-Semitic and anti- liberal
                        riots continues to arrive from all parts, from Archangel to Tiflis and from
                        Poland to Tomsk. They are generally the result of what are called patriotic
                        or conservative manifesta- tions, which are organized under the auspices of
                        the police, and formed of mobs headed by the Imperial banner or by a
                        portrait of the Tsar. There have been hundreds oi killed and wounded at
                        Rostoff-on-Don and at Krement- chug. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The Tsar's manifesto restoring all the an- cient liberties of Finland has
                        been published at Helsingfors.The constitutionalists are sa- tisfied, but
                        the revolutionaries demand further concessions. The revolutionists have
                        proved their control over the masses by countermanding yester- day's
                        demonstration, announcing that they would choose their own day, and not
                        accept one of Trepoff's choosing, for the last fight. M. Witte has not made
                        the least progress in the formation of a Cabinet The Conservatives avoid him
                        ; the Liberals show themselves dis- trustful, while the reactionaries detest
                        him. A few weeks' full is expected, during which the revolutionary party
                        will perfect their organisation. A fresh manifesto assures the people that
                        the reforms will be inflexibly carried out despite the efforts of the
                        enemies of reform, but the Government must have the coopera- tion of the
                        pacific majority. {Reuter)</p>

                        religious notables and a follower of the Hanafi rite. He was educated at Al
                        Azhar, where he became ulema after showing considerable theological
                        proficiency, and was for a long period Mufti to the now suppressed
                        Beit-el-Mal Administration. He was later appointed to the Mehkemeh High
                        Court as Cadi and showed such legal and theological acumen that he gained
                        the good opinion of the bulk of Egyptian Moslems. He was acting as Grand
                        Cadi in the place of Sheikh Yehia, who has gone on an important errand to
                        Constantinople, when the death of Sheikh Abdul Kader El Raffei threw open to

                        Delancey street taken by him to Egypt sold as a white slave into bondage,
                        and rescued by the efforts of the International Society for the Suppression
                        of the White Slave Trade, has just come to light through a letter sent by
                        the girl to her brothers in New York. Her courtship was a short one, and she
                        was married at her home, No. 132, Attorney street last July. Four weeks
                        later she disappeared and was not heard of until last weak, when the society
                        sent her to her brothers after they had rescued her. Her introduction to
                        Lederer, it was said, was brought about by Mrs. Nathan Weber, who lives at
                        No. 122, Suffolk street She had $300 in bank in her own name and this must
                        have been, withdrawn without her knowledge, for in her letter she asks that
                        her fare home may be paid out of this money. The letter to her brothers is
                        in her own handwriting and is as follows: “My Dear Brothers—I am unable to

                        treacherous and has fooled me all along. He brought me to Alexandria and has
                        made me a prisoner of other men. I wish you to go to court and get
                        duplicates of the documents which show that I am his wife, as he has stolen
                        the original papers from me. Buy a ticket for me to return, for he has taken
                        all my money from me. Iam very sick and cannot write much more. Molfie.”

                    <p>We mentioned in our issue of the 16th ultimo two serious infringements of the
                        new pharmacy regulations which oome into ope- ration about a year ago. These
                        prove how necessary it is for the Sanitary Adminis- tration to use the
                        utmost vigilance for safe- guarding the public. In one case a Greek named
                        Pistis, when applying for permission to open a pharmacy, sent in a diploma
                        that was ascertained to have belonged to a man who had been dead since 1896!
                        In the other case three individuals sent in diplomas pur- porting to have
                        been issued by the Faculty of Medicine of Athens bat which, when subjected
                        to expert examination, were found to be forged. The officials of the
                        Department, since the new regulations came into operation, have taken in
                        hand the inspection of pharmacies but it seems they are greatly hampered by
                        the action of the Tribunals, who, when clear cases of irregularities are
                        brought to their notice, inflict such a ridioulously small punish- ment that
                        it cannot possibly act as a de- terrent. Recently, we are informed, at Man-
                        sourah, two individuals, one a Greek and the other an Italian, were summoned
                        for keeping a pharmacy open for three months without a certificated chemist.
                        The Tribunal Mixte de Contravention inflicted for this grave offence the
                        minimum fine of P.T. 5 in one case and P.T. 10 in the other!</p>

                        that this innovation will be taken full advantage of, and owing to the poor
                        restaurants aud high rents at Alex- andria such accommodation will be a
                        great advantage to residents. Another special feature of the hotel will be
                        the cooking.The leading "chef” at the Metro- pole Hotel, Moote Carlo, has
                        been engaged, and arrived on Sunday last with an entire brigade of
                        gastronomic artists selected with the utmost care from among the leading
                        European hotels and restaurants. During the winter the Khedivial Hotel
                        management will give a ball once a fortnight, as is the custom in Cairo.
                        There is to be a grand “Reveillon” at the hotel at Christmas, which will be
                        the formal opening fete of the hotel. Every night when there is a
                        performance at the Zizinia Theatre there will be a special supper menu at a
                        fixed inclusive price, and a band will play from midnight until 2 p.m. A
                        large American bar is to be opened on December 1, which will be equal to the
                        finest bar in Egypt. The hotel is under the manage- ment of Mr. E. Fleury,
                        late manager of the Nonvel Hotel at Vichy and of the Alexandra Hotel at
                        Monte Carlo. </p>

                        develop its business throughout Egypt and the Sudan. The board of directors
                        will henceforth be in Cairo, with only two directors in London. The company

                    <p>One of the wealthiest families at Assiout is the Khaehabah family, writes our
                        Assiout Correspondent. They had four large houses at Assiout. One was burnt
                        down four months ago, another two months ago, and the remain- ing two last
                        week. The fire broke out at 11 p.m. and in aboat two hours, the two houses
                        were a blazing mass. The loss is estimated at £8,000. It is a remarkable
                        coin- cidence that in all three cases the cause of this outbreak was
                        accidental. Our correspondent states that Assiout. is very badly supplied
                        with pumps. In the fire mentioned the house was burning for a whole hour
                        before the pumps arrived, and after they came it took another hour to put
                        them in working order. Thanks are due to Mr. Russell, the Interior
                        inspector, who worked hard all night, as on the previous occasions.</p>

                        Les nouvelles actions sont donc souscrites a moins de 115 francs, car depuis
                        de nombreuses annees deja, le dividende du "Banco di Roma" eat consolide a
                        fr. 7; ce qui vent dire que ces actions presentent le rare avantage d’un

                    <p>Mr. H.E Garle again writes to the "Times" with references to the above, as
                        follows: Sir,—May I, in view of tbe references to this matter in your issue
                        of the 23td inst., again trespass upon your space. Tbe proceedings in
                        question had nothing whatever to do with the trial of the action and the
                        merits of the question were not even gone into. The next-of-kin’s legal
                        adviser in Egypt was of opinion that, in all the circumstances, the Egyptian
                        Courts should be asked to restrain any payment of the surplus in the hands
                        of the Daira Sanieh Limited to the Egyptian Govern- ment; and this is all
                        that was done, and is all that has failed The next-of-kin's main claim is
                        against the Egyptian Government and tho Daira Sanieh of H.H. the Khedive ;
                        it has not been tried, and will not be tried for some time to come. The
                        proceedings that have taken-place are in truth, little more than the
                        equivalent to a stop order in this country, and even so, are being appealed
                        against. I earnestly trust that you will see your way to give the same
                        prominence to this letter that you did to my last, for it is even more impor
                        tant that your statement in your issue of the 23rd inst. be answered than
                        that in your issue- of the 18th Inst. I am. Sir. your obedient servant H.
