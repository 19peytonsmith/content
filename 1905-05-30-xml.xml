                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>

                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only requires
                        the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and easily applied
                        with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third the cost of paint.
                        HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals
                        alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special
                        value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing colours, great
                        weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends itself to every kind
                        of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all the advantages of paint,
                        colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the cost of oil paint. It never
                        blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that it can be washed adds greatly to
                        its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA. HARBOUR.
                    NEW PASS TO BE MADE.
                    IMPORTANT UNDERTAKING.</head>
                    <p>A most important improvement in the port of Alexandria is to be undertaken
                        immediately, and to morrow the first dredger for the work is arriving at
                        Alexandria. The Egyptian Government has determined to construct anewpassfor
                        entrance to the harbour as owing to the enormous and continuous increase in
                        the size of modern vessels the present entry by way of the Boghaz pass is
                        too small for the largest type of ships. For instance, when the White Star
                        liner “Celtic” arrived here the season before last she had to lie outside
                        the harbour.</p>
                    <p>The Boghsz pass is only 31 feet in depth and can only admit as a maximum
                        vessels drawing from 29 to 30 feet of water, and then only in the smoothest
                        sea. The Dew pass is to bo dredged to the depth of 35 feet and will thus be
                        able to admit the largest ships alloat</p>
                    <p>The dredger, which arrives from Malta tomorrow, is convoyed by H. M. S.
                        “Juno," a second-class cruiser under the command or Captain Christian, R.N.
                        This dredger, the “St. Lawrence,” belongs to the Admiralty and is of the
                        type known as “Saints.” She has very powerful machinery and it is expected
                        that her dredging capacity is approximately six hundred tons per hour.</p>
                    <p>The construction of the new pass will begin at once. It will make the harbour
                        most efficient for the alternative entrance will be especially useful when
                        one orotherof the passes gets blocked. The new pass will be the same as the
                        present pass from a navigator’s point of view, with leading lights.</p>
                    <p>The Ports and Lighthouses Administration is also negotiating with the
                        Admiralty for the hire of a second dredger for the same work. Another
                        dredger is arriving from Cyprus in about ten days’ time.</p>

                    <p>The report of the annual general meeting of the Land and Mortgage Company of Egypt should afford considerable encouragement to the various land and trust companies which have been lately started in Egypt, for if this company can find such scope for useful and extensive operations, there is no reason why the new ventures should not have equally pleasant prospects. That the making of loans on first mortgage can be made remunerative is evidenced by the satisfactory story which the chair-man, Sir E. L. Pemberton, had to tell at the meeting in London on Saturday week. The dividend of 10 per cent. is the highest ever declared by the company. The chairman explained that although in consequence of increasing competition the rate of interest had been reduced, the loans were so well placed that no falling off in the business need be anticipated. Looking at the above results, it is evident that the company’s prosperity is increasing with that of the country generally.</p>

                    <p>Colonel Harrison, who has been ill since his return home, has been engaged in
                        making all arrangements before the pigmies’ arrival in England. The
                        directors of the London Hippodrome have engaged them to appear at the London
                        Hippodrome immediately after their arrival at the Royal Albert Docks,
                        probably on June 5.</p>
                    <p>There is a sort of disposition still prevalent to regard these little people
                        as filling, more or less, the part of the “missing link,” but low though
                        they stand in the comparative social scale, they seem to present no marked
                        features whatever to warrant their being placed outside the class of various
                        other ill-developed peoples. Even the silence and apathy of which so much
                        has been made are fully paralleled among the Indian forest races of South
                        America. They are directly attributable to the oppressive gloom and monotony
                        of the surroundings in which for generations they have passed their</p>
                    <p>It is not generally known that several of these little people have been
                        educated and baptised in connection with the C.M.S. Mission in the Uganda
                        Protectorate. One of them is a teacher in a mission school in Toro, near the
                        Ruwenzori Mountains. Writing of the school to children in England, a lady
                        missionary says : "Listen to this ; one class that is being taught by a
                        pigmy from Stanley’s Great Forest, who recently was baptised. His name is
                        Bulasio, and be is very fond of dealing out whacks with that little cane,
                        whenever a pupil slackens in his reading, or does not show him due
                        respect.”</p>

                    <p>The following is the report of the board of directors of the Anglo-American
                        Nile Steamers &amp; Hotel Co., Ltd., read at the general meeting of share
                        holders held in Cairo to-day :—</p>
                    <p>The directors, in presenting their fifth annual report and balance sheet, are
                        able to congratulate the shareholders on a year or exceptional prosperity in
                        the history of the company, and to point to a steady increase in all
                        branches of their business, the profits from all sources rising from LE.
                        18,086 in 1903 to L.E. 19,471 in 1904, and LE. 24,197 in 1905. These results
                        have been achieved in the face of very severe competition in the freight
                        service dating from the reduction of the Railway Administration’s tariff,
                        which involved a corresponding decrease in the rates charged by the company.
                        The increase of river and canal traffic between Cairo and Alexandria had led
                        to the issue of certain Government regulations which, if adhered to, are
                        likely to have serious results upon the future of transport by steam barge
                        in this country, Representations are, however, being made to the Public

                    <p>Allusion was made in the last report to an arrangement by virtue of which an option on the unissued share capital of the company was given against £10,000 of debentures in the company taken firm by a local group and the New Egyptian Company. The results of this operation have been fully commensurate with the directors’ expectations. A valuable holding has been secured in the Menzaleh Canal and Navigation Company shares; the order for the construction of their fleet is being carried out in the company’s workshops ; and the central management thereof is assured to this company for a period of two years at a remuneration of £500 per annum.</p>

                    <p>Apart from profits derived from the usual sources of business, a special profit has been made on the sale of the Savoy Hotel at Assouan, which has been transferred for a sum of £60,000 to the newly-formed Upper Egypt Hotels Co. The sale was made for cash, and the second instalment of £30,000 has been paid over since the accounts have been closed. The directors are of opinion that this profit should be considered as extraordinary and dealt with accordingly. They therefore propose that ten thousand pounds shall be placed to reserve and that the whole of the preliminary expenses, amounting to L.E. 2,983.202 m/m, be written off. The continued existence of this account, which has no realisable value, appears to them undesirable. The directors, although entitled by law and precedent to their percentage of this profit, are strongly of opinion that in cases where a profit is dealt with as extraordinary and not distributed by way of dividend, the Board should also forego their claim to a share in it. No deduction on this account has therefore been made.</p>

                    <p>The sale of the Savoy Hotel had allowed of the amortisation of the debenture debt of the company amounting to £35,000. The interest on these debentures at the rate of six per cent. constituted a heavy charge for the company, and the directors are confident, that should occasion to borrow arise in the future, they will be able to do so on more advantageous terms. As amortisation only commenced as from May 1, no change is shown in the balance-sheet in the total amount of debentures outstanding on 30th April, 1904.</p>

The cause of the discussion is somewhat shrouded in mystery, but there is no doubt that it is a case “cherchez la femme,” having due regard to the locality.

                        all possibility of shortage of water supply will be removed as by that time
                        the Water Company will have start ed pumping water from the artesian wells
                        at Rod-el Farag, which will enable them to pump an extra 25,000 cubic metres
                        of water per day, should the necessity arise. This method of water supply
                        will be continued for two years, when, if it is found satisfactory, the
                        system will be entirely adopted, and the present system done away with. But

                        thus prevent any shortage.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the insufficient supply, of which we have of late received
                        complaints, we learn that the maximum amount which the company is compelled
                        to pump per day, according to the contract with the Government, is 30,000
                        cubic metres, whereas they have pumped as much as 75,000 cubic metres in one
                        day. It is also interesting to note that they have pumped 68,101, 940 litres
                        of water so far this year, whilst during the corresponding period last year
                        they only pumped 44, 835, 880 litres, thus making an increase of 23, 266,
                        060 litres.</p>

                        P.T. 3-5 per block. The company informs us that they sell the whole of the
                        ice produced to Messrs. Boehms and Anderer, who are under control not to
                        sell at any higher rate than P.T.3-5, whatever the consumption may be, and
                        it is only on account of people buying ice from other persons than the
                        recognised agents that a higher rate is paid.</p>

                    <p>The native Press is speculating a good deal on the reasons which led to the

                        said that he went to Constantinople in order to settle the question of the
                        Coptic Convent at Jerusalem. Another theory is that he is to be Prime
                        Minister on the retirement of Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, and so he has gone to
                        England to make himself acquainted with the King.</p>

                        made him not only an Earl but the owner of eighty thousand acres. Lord
                        Galloway was known until that event occurred as Captain Randolph Stewart, of
                        the Black Watch, a veteran of Crimea and of the Mutiny, and in October next
                        he will be entering upon his seventieth year. Descended from the Stewarts of
                        whom the Kings of Scotland and of England were a branch, Lord Galloway owes
                        his title to that Sir Alexander Stewart who, in 1607, was created Lord of

                    <p>A.S.C. AND PIGEON SHOOTING.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                    <p>Sir,-- I was delighted to see the noble protest of your correspondent in
                        to-day’s “Gazette” against the scheme of having pigeon shooting at the
                        Alexandria Sporting Club. The latest London papers announce that this wicked
                        and cruel so-called “sport” has been expelled from Hurlingham. Every genuine
                        sportsman will rejoice at the decision of the Hurlingham Club to erase
                        pigeon shooting from the list of “sports” practised at the club. It would be
                        difficult to advance a single argument in favor of its continuance, save
                        that of ancient usage, from which standpoint is claims are equalled, if not
                        surpassed, by those of cock-fighting or bear-baiting. Even in its least
                        objectionable form, pigeon-shooting falls far below the modern standard of
                        sport, in the lack of a fair chance of escape for the quarry. In its lower,
                        hole-and-corner aspects, it lends itself to abominable cruelties, inflicted
                        upon the birds in order to affect their flight when they rise from the trap.
                        The value of Hurlingham’s decision lies not only in its immediate effect,
                        but in the promise which it holds out that either by force of example or by
                        actual legislation the “sport” may be abolished altogether throughout
                        England, and a blot which disfigures our sporting annals be thus for ever
                        removed. Let the A.S.C. take note, I am, Sir,</p>
                    <p> SPORTSMAN</p>
