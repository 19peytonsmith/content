            THE END OF THE WAR.
            armistice signed.
            PRESS CRITICISMS.
            St. Petersburg, September 1.
            An official communication in relating the
            history of the peace negotiations, confirms
            that, at the moment when a rupture seemed
            imminent, President Roosevelt appealed to
            the Tsar's humanitarian sentiments, and beg-
            ged him to accept th8 new Japanese proposal
            that Russia should pay Japan twelve hundred
            million yen for northern Saghalien. The Tsar
            rejected this proposal, whereupon Japan re-
            nounced the re-imbnrsement of expenses and
            claimed southern Saghalien, undertaking not
            to fortify it, nor to take any military measures
            to keep La Perouse Straits closed.
            The effect the publication of the terms of
            peace will produce on the Japanese publio is
            awaited with impatience, and the apprehension
            is expressed that possibly the work of the
            conference may be destroyed.	(Reuter)
            Tokio, September 1.
            The Government does not yet intend to
            issue the statement of the terms of peace, but
            the feeling is spreading that Japan has made
            great concessions.
            The newspapers generally express extreme
            dissatisfaction at this prospect.
            A leading radical paper urges the interven-
            tion of the people in order to prevent a nation-

            A Mad Horse ?—A sal's named Hassan
            Mobamed Mekhawi was attacked by a horse
            yesterday. The animal seized him by the

            severe injuries. Measures are being taken to
            discover whether the horse is suffering from
            rabies, while the sals has been taken to
            hospital.	^____
            Firework Accident.—During the discharge
            of fireworks by the harbour last night a resi-
            dent of Cairo, Abd el Nejid Effeudi Hamdi,
            twenty-five years of age, ooming too near the
            fireworks was killed instantanoo sly by an
            unexpectedly violent explosion. The same
            discharge inflicted serious injuries on a native
            named Gellab Haiba.
            SULTAN’S ACCESSION FETES.
            AT CAIRO.
            The Reopening.of the Schools —Not only
            by the young scholars, who vies the prospect
            with regret, is this fact-to be considered, but
            also by those to whom a knowledge of English,
            French, German, Arabic, and Greek is every
            day more necessary. All naturally enter their
            names at the Berlitz Schools (Alexandria and
            Cairo) whore the number of pupils belonging
            to the highest social positions increases from
            day to. day.	26381-1
            The Post Office.—The oontinual increase
            in the demand for house to house delivery in
            Cairo and Alexandria renders it absolutely
            necessary that all persons in these towns
            desirous of suoh delivery shall have the number
            of the house and name of the street in which
            they live indicated on their correspondence.
            Should by any chance a street be unnamed,
            then the quarter of the town in which it is
            situated must be indicated. Attention to these
            instruotioDS is imperative to avoid delay and
            °rrors in the delivery of correspondence.
            A Record of the Eclipse.—We have receiv-
            ed from M. Reiser, photographer, an excellent
            record of the partial eolipse of the sun at Alex-
            andria in the form of a photograph which gives
            au accurate impression of Jtbe phenomenon as
            viewed from here. The sun appears as a small
            orescent surrounded in its immediate neigh-
            boured by an irregular sphere of light. The
            degree of darkuess is of course somewhat
            exaggerated on aocount of the lens of tbe
            camera having t6 be darkened so that a defined
            impression of the main objeot might be obtain-
            ed, bnt the appearance of the sea is very
            faithfully portrayed.
            Throughout yesterday the Cairo streets
            presented an appearanoe of exceptional gaiety,
            both from the profuse deooration of almost
            every building and from the large number
            of people who seemed to be making holiday in
            honor of the great event of the celebration
            of the twenty-ninth anniversary of the Sultan’s
            accession. To attempt any description of the
            deco rations would be to repeat an oft-told
            tale; they were very similar to those whioh
            wo have seen on many other occasions, with,
            perk aps, the exception that they were rather
            more extensive than usual, for the gene-
            ral feeling prevailed that the occasion
            should be one of exceptional rejoicing
            on account of his Majesty’s happy escape
            from the dastardly plot against his life.
            Business was carried on as usual in commercial
            circles, but the dosing of the Ministries and
            public offices greatly increased the numbers
            seen in the streets during the day time.
            As the day progressed the crowds grew
            larger, and shortly after half past seven, the
            Esbakieh Gardens, in which the great festivities
            were to be held, were lit up, and many of the
            principal buildings were also most? effectively
            illuminated and afforded an exceedingly bril-
            liant appearance.
            The gardens were thrown open to the publio
            at 9 p.m. and the view on entering was excel-
            lent A special approaoh to the reception tent
            was lined with lamps, Chinese lanterns were
            mng between these, while the red of the
            Turkish and Egyptian flags was to be seen
            everywhere.
            It is needless to say that huge crowds as-
            sembled to assist at the festivities; the gardens
            seemed to be one mass of people, and the tents
            and booths of entertainment were orowded to
            their utmost oapaoity. Suoh a crowd was easily
            roused to enthusiasm by singers, danoers,
            tumblers, and contortionists, and good-humour
            prevailed everywhere. Military music and the
            noise of tom-toms and various other native
            instruments greeted the ear wherever one turn-
            ed, and at times the noise was almost deafening.
            Excellent order was maintained both inside
            and outride the gardens, and in spite of the
            groat crowds, many of whose members were
            every m 'ment in peril of being run over by
            arsbeah s frequently passing backwards and
            forwards, no acoidents, bo far as we are aware,
            have been reported. The police, under the
            direction cf the aoting commandant, are to be
            congratulated on the manner in which they
            insured the publio safety.
            AT ALEXANDRIA.
            The twenty-ninth anniversary of the acces-
            sion of H.I.M. the Sultan was officially
            oalebrated by a banquet given last night at
            Rrjs el Tin Palace by, H.E. Fakhry Pasha, the
            acting Regent. Among the guests we— tba.
            Ministers, the British Chargd d’Affaires and
            the members of tl*e Consular and Diplomatic
            Corps,' the Commissioners of the Caisse de la
            Dette, the Aoting Advisers and Under-Seore-
            tarios of State, the Heads of Administrations,
            the Officer Commanding the Army of Occupa-
            tion, etc. The Palace had been brilliant-
            ly doooiatod for the occasion, the Aida was
            very prettily and effectively hung with lanterns,
            and the Abd el Moneim from time to time
            throw her searchlight over the water on to the
            palace. After tbe banquet oame a very flue
            display of fireworks, whioh lasted till about
            10 p.m., oulminating in the discharge of a
            huge sheaf of rockets, whioh lit up the whole
            harbour, first with rose and green and then
            with golden and purple light
            The Khedivial Yacht Club was lit up, and
            the fifty diners on the verandah had an
            admirable view, whilo a good band and an
            oxcollent dinner specially prepared for the
            occasion made the evening very agreeable.
            After dinner tho fireworks oould be seen
            admirably from the olub jetty, and few of the
            members loft the olub honse till long after
            midnight.
            Elsewhere on the shore both the Coast Guard
            station and Custom House were decorated and
            the Ottoman Bank and Gonvernorat were
            illuminated with hundreds of small lamps, that
            formed among other patterns the star anc
            crescent of the Turkish Empire. Turkish musio,
            or what we believe to have been Turkish
            music, was played by a military band near the
            Gonvernorat and some speoial performances
            were given at various musio halls which attract-
            ed large audienoes.
            The Ras el Tin road was orowded by persons
            anxious to witnoss the fireworks, and native
            Alexandria as a rule retired late to bed.
            FITTING ANNIVERSARY GIFT.
            As we go to press t&e news reaohes us by pri-
            vate telegram that the Turkish foroes have
            recaptured Sana’ from the Yemen rebels. This
            viotory of Ahmed Faizi Pasha will come as
            particularly gratifying news to a seotion of the
            Moslem world, occurring as it did on the
            oocasion of the anniversary of H.I.M. the
            Sultan’s accession.
            We mult postpone further remark upon this
            great event in the history of the present
            rebellion in the Yemen until onr next issue, as
            time prevents us referring to it at any length.

            THE SUCRERIES D’EGYPTE.
            MEETING IN PARIS.
            The “Journal du Cairo" has recsived a com-
            munication from the Socidtd des Suoreries et
            de la Raffilerie d’Egypte, whioh we give in
            English and French owing to its great import-
            ant to the public, to the effeot that as soon as
            th% death of M. Cronier was known at Paris,
            the Administrative Board met to discuss the
            situation. MM. Barois, Laronx, de la Bouglise
            and Dorison were present and Sir Elwin
            Palmer and Sir E. Cassel also attended the
            meeting, their functions being purely advisory.
            In oonsequeuoe of the advioe of these gentle-
            men and of Me. Barboux and Me Carton de
            Wiart, who were also present, the Board has
            given orders to the Cairo headquarters of the
            3ncreries d’Egypte to publish the balance sheet
            up to date as soon as possible. M. Girard, tbe
            chief accountant of the company, has therefore
            >een recalled from leave and will arrive at
            Cairo next Tuesday. The balance sheet will be
            published in the course of next week.
            In reply to a question asked by a repre-
            sentative of our contemporary “Le Journal du
            Cairo”, the Hon. A. Davey made the following
            statement. ’Even should M. Cronier have
            fraudulently pledged the company’s credit,
            which is still a pure hypothesis, we have every
            reason to hope that the crisis will terminate
            happily and that nothing will justify the fears
            of some alarmist,’. Our advice to the publio—
            the only advioe we can give, under the circum-
            stances—is to wait for more news from Paris
            as calmly as possible It may not be exhilarating,
            but it is the only possible course.

            Pour hater oette operation, le comptable de
            la Societe, M. Girard, a ete rappeie d’urgenoe.
            II sera an Cairo mardi prochsio. La Societe des

            curiosite du publio que qnand les comptes
            seront termines, e’eat-k-dire dans le courant de
            la semsiue prochaine.
            Le reporter du journal ayant posd aux
            membres du Comite la question de savoir dans
            quelle mesure les operations persounelles de
            M. Cronier pouvaient engager les Suoreries.
            II est impossible, lui a-t-il ete repondu, de
            connaltre la v*rit* avant que les comptes per-
            sonnels de M. Cronier aieut ete etablis k Paris.
            II est possible quele krach ah one repercussion

            oas les depfiohea re9ues jusqu’ici de Paris ne
            nous laissent rien deviner.
            Toutefois, la situation actuclle n’arrfite en
            rien le travail des Sucreries et toutes les ope-
            rations oourantes pour preparer la campagne
            prochaine suiveut le cours normal.
            ' M. Davey ajoute que la question de la re-
            percussion du krach mise k part, et il iusiste
            encore sur ce fait qu’il est absolument impos-

            THE ECLIPSE AT ASSOUAN.
            INTERESTING ACCOUNT.
            One of the spectators has kindly famished
            as with the following interesting account of
            the eclipse as seen from the roof of the Savoy
            Hotel, Assouan :—
            After 8nme discussion as to where to go to
            see the 6clipse at Asrouan, whether it would
            be best to mount a hill on the west bank,
            hang abont one of tbe missions or go on to
            the roof of tbe hotel, we settled on the roof
            as eaeier to climb than the hill and nearer to
            refreshments than either of the others. As it
            turned out, it was an excellent place to see it
            from. A field glass, with tbe object glasses
            smoked, and a separate blue glass, formed an
            easy and efficient means of seeing the eolipee
            from a layman’s point 'of view, and allowed
            two sun spots to be easily distinguished.
            Mounting on the roof one saw the first oontact
            whioh took place oh the south east-comer of
            the rim cf the sun. In watching the different
            phases for an hour or so until totality, it
            was interesting to remark the decreasing glare
            and heat as the sun became more covered,
            but np to the very last a smoked lens was
            necessary ou the field glasses.
            When almost half covered, the effect on
            the landscape was as if one was looking
            through blue glass. A strange effeot, very
            easy to notice when once seen, was that rayB
            of light when broken by branches of trees, etc.
            would not appear to be made up of multitudes
            of circles of the same form as the sun, which
            is how we always see the m, bnt they were
            made up of multitudes of crescents of the
            same form as the partially eclipsed sun. This
            was bast seen where the rays were thrown on
            a wall which had been broken up by straw
            matting with which a window was entirely
            oovered.
            The period of totality, which lasted about
            two and a half minutes, was intensely interest-
            ing .and all too soon over, there was so much
            to look out for in such a short time. ?
            The shadow bauds, whioh occur just before
            and just after totality were seen well on a sheet
            hung on a wall.
            When most clearly defiaed they appeared as
            parallel bands of light and dark shadows about
            four inohes wide. They seemed clearest just
            after they were observed, both before and after
            totality, and gradually faded away. They
            moved across the sheet in a second or two in
            the same direction as the shadow of the moon
            passed across the sun, and were inclined at
            about right angles to the inclination of its
            path.
            No sooner was the snn entirely covered than
            an orange-red eroption was remarkable at the
            8pot where the light of the snn was last seen;
            this gradually diminished in size and di-
            sappeared. A similar spot, observed a few
            seconds before totality was over at a point
            diametrically opposite to that mentioned above,
            which increased in sizs until it was absorbed, in
            the light of the snn.
            The oorona, which is a halo of light round
            the eolipse with loDg rays shooting from it,
            appeared as canary-yellow for a depth of about
            one tenth of the sun’s diameter and faded off
            into an irregularly shaped cross whose longest
            arm was two or three snn diameters. The ap-
            pearanoe of these arms was that of thin wind-
            tom clouds on a background of inky blue, the
            eolipse itself appearing absolutely black.
            The totality phase was, so far, more interest-
            ing than the phases where the sun was slowly
            being covered and the hot roof of the hotel was
            deserted soon after totality, refreshments being
            found to be more interesting than watching
            the sun reassert itself.
            Of the Boientifio instruments the “oross-eyed
            lady” belonging to the Amerioan expedition
            o tiled forth most remarks. It oonserted of four
            telescopes ooupled up so that eaoh gave a large
            plate photograph of a quarter of the sun’s sur-
            face. It required seven men to work it, one to
            change each plate half way through totality,
            one to put on the ‘ oap,” one to count the time
            on a pendulum, and one to give the word to
            the plate changers. This took a deal of rehears-
            ing to get the four plates obanged together in
            the shortest possible time, and the “dress
            rehearsal” was given the evening before in
            twilight, approximately that expeoted at the
            eclipse, when the plates were ohanged in
            eight seconds.
            All the telescopes gave photographio records,
            and they or the rtHectors were kept bearing
            on the sun by clockwork. They were mostly
            placed horizontally, the sun’s image being re-
            flected into them.

            The Prime Minister is expeoted to return

            THURSDAY'S ECLIPSE.
            (From our Correspondent).
            Port Said, Friday.
            In continuation of my report on the partial
            eolipse as seen from here, 1 might add that the
            actual amount of the son’s disc whioh was
            obscured amounted to 27'30'. This is the
            degree as measured by a good sextant, and, I
            should say, is at any rate approximately
            accurate. Another point of interest whioh I
            might remark on is the fact that, in spile
            of a southerly wind, whioh ordinarily lowen
            the depth of water at this part of the ooast,
            this morning there were 37 am. more water
            at the guages than normal; and it is probable
            the same phenomenon will be noticeable during
            some days yet, in a gradually diminiahing
            degree.
            
            HASHI8H SEIZURE.
            I hear that yesterday the ooastguard bn the
            canal succeeded in oapturing some ten bags of
            hashish without much difficulty near Dover
            soir. It is not known whether the smugglers
            were taken or not.

            This oompany, whioh continues to draw
            good houses, is giving, in addition to the
            usual performance, on Sunday a matinbe
            especially for the younger generation. Tbe
            biosoope is invariably well received, and the
            programme generally teems successful.
            COLLISION IN THE HARBOUR.
            A slight collision occurred on W ednesday
            between two ships manoeuvring close to the
            Canal entrance. The damage to both was slight,
            with the exception of the fact that the search-
            light of the larger was, I believe, badly broken.

            The Foudre and her attendant fleet of
            torpedo boats areto leave here early on Sunday
            so that the latter may be able to reach Sues
            before nightfall The . Foudre will, however,

            AQUATIC SPORTS.
            Several members ot the New English Club
            have organised aquatie sports to bp held close
            to where the Congal now lias on Saturday
            afternoon. I hear the entries are numerous,
            and everything points to the probability of a.
            suooessful and amusing meeting. Port Said
            greatly lacks the forms of amusement so
            oommon elsewhere, and the advent of soch in
            the shape of gymkhanas and sports is always
            received with much pleasure.
            THE WEATHER
            * Daring the past week we have had most
            nmbearably damp, hot days. Tbe morning
            sun has frequently heralded a light southerly
            wind which has usually fallen entirely by
            9 a.m. leaving us with a damp heat throughout
            the day. Complaints are beard on all rides,
            and it is sinoerely to be hoped the welcome
            ohange will Boon come.

            AMATEUR E8TATK BROKERS.
            To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
            Sir—I was very glad indeed to read your re-
            marks on the above in your issue of the 30th
            of last month. It is not, however, only the
            employes of the Ministries of the Interior
            and Finance who indulge in illegal broking,
            but the employes of the post office, and espe-
            cially those of the Mixed Tribunal, are to a
            very large extent implioated, and it is quite
            time for the authorities to intervene and put
            a stop to suoh dealings, by insisting upon
            their employes adhering to the rules, and
            imposing, severs punishmsnt on ai y one in-
            fringing same. These employ**, owing to tkeir
            position, are able to learn more than tho pro-
            fessional broker,, and they thus oome between
            biyer, seller, and broker, and very often spoil
            a transaction half oonoloded. 'Government
            should, indeed, impose a license tax on pro-
            fessional brokers, end I am sure that all respoo-
            table br ken would gladly pay even LK 80
            far the first year, and five pounds or more per
            year for the renewal of suoh lioensos, provided
            that e clause is irserted to the iff sot that
            no sole shall he legal union signed b, .
            lioensed broker. In this way there weald he
            fewer broken, to the benefit of buyer, seller
            end broker alike. I hope that yea will find my
            suggestion a fair ooa.—I am. Sir; ete.
