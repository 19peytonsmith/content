                    cruiser "Almaz" which was only published yesterday evening. It says that the

                    were sunk during Saturday’s fighting. After the "Almaz" had left the fleet, the
                    battle was resumed in the darkness and the "Almaz,’’ being unable to rejoin the
                    squadron, proceeded to Vladivostok. The details of subsequent fighting are

                <p>(Official). Admiral Rodjestvensky and another Admiral, both severely wounded, and
                    numerous Staff officers were captured on board the destroyer "Boevoi." The
                    Japanese losses are not yet determined but it is believed that no ship has been
                    seriously damaged. The first division lost about 400 men and Admiral Misu is
                    wounded. The Russians lost altogether 22 ships with an aggregate tonnage of
                    153,411 tons. The battle and pursuit lasted from Saturday morning until Monday
                    morning. The Japanese were unrelaxing in their efforts until they had gathered

                <p>The defeat of the Baltic fleet has given a fresh impetus to the clamour of the

            <div type="item"><head>THE COTTON CUT WORM</head>
                <p>INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS.</p>
                <p>Some interesting and successful experiments in trying to combat the cotton cut
                    worm (Agro tis Ypsilan) have been carried out at Kharaba, on the lands of the
                    Aboukir Company. The Khedivial Agricultural Society sent their entomologist, Mr.
                    Willcocks, to examine a method of dealing with the pest proposed by Mr.
                    Richmond, and we understand that Mr. Willcocks was to impressed with the system
                    employed that he strongly urged the society to arrange for experiments to be
                    carried out in the Behera province, where this particular pest causes so much
                    damage to the young cotton. The same worm has this year also cleared off a great
                    part of the berseem which was left to seed. Unfortunately the society have
                    postponed putting the method to further practical tests till next year, although
                    there was plenty of time to act on their entomologist’s advice.</p>
                <p>Mr. Richmond’s method of dealing with the pest is based on making the cotton
                    fields distasteful to the female moth, so as to prevent her laying her eggs on
                    the cotton fields or at the roots of the young plants. To do this he advises
                    that with the first watering which is given to the fields after sowing the seed,
                    two to three gallons of petroleum should be applied for each feddan.</p>
                <p>The simplest method of applying the petroleum is to bore a tiny hole in the
                    bottom of a full 33 lb. tin containing 4 gallons and place the tin on a board at
                    the point where the water is being run on to the field. The petroleum falls in a
                    tiny stream or almost in drops on to the running water and is quite sufficient
                    to make the necessary film.</p>
                <p>As the irrigation water sinks into the soil it leaves behind it a very fine film
                    of petroleum, which is most distasteful to the moth, whilst it does no harm to
                    the germinating cotton. This is prevention of attack and for that reason a very
                    valuable precaution.</p>
                <p>The greatest damage is done a few days after the plant makes its appearance above
                    ground, when the stem is very thin and easily gnawed through by the caterpillar.
                    With the second watering the petroleum should be applied in the same quantity
                    and manner as previously. After the second watering the plants quickly become
                    strong enough to withstand stem attacks, which are the most fatal.</p>
                <p>The petroleum film on the fields should kill any eggs and newly hatched
                    caterpillars with which it comes in contact. This may be called cure, of a value
                    only second to prevention. The method is a very simple one, very cheap, and can
                    be applied by any cultivator. Petroleum can be obtained in any village in Egypt
                    at about P.T. 10 per tin. Half a tin will do a feddan, and the sole instructions
                    to the fellah are to make a very small hole with a pin. The experiments are to
                    be continued in the autumn on the young berseem crop, which is generally badly
                    attacked by Agrotis at Aboukir if the berseem is sown early.</p>
                <p>From caterpillars collected at Kharaba Mr. Richmond finds that the chrysalis
                    stage is 14 days and the presumption is that there are a succession of broods
                    during the summer.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to note that two of the caterpillars which were being watched
                    were badly attacked by parasites which appeared to bo the larva of an Ichneumon
                    fly. Those larva bored their way out of the bodies of the two caterpillars and
                    spun small yellowish white cocoons for themselves. Both caterpillars attacked by
                    the parasites died, being unable to turn themselves into pupae. The cocoons of
                    Ichneumon flys should on no account be destroyed.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>THE SUEZ CANAL</head>
                <p>DIVIDEND AND DISSATISFACTION.</p>
                <p>A London correspondent writes:—</p>
                <p>Considerable dissatisfaction is expressed in shipping circles at the decision of
                    the directors of the Suez Canal Company to pay a dividend of 28 per cent. on
                    account of 1904, as against 26 per cent. for the previous year. It had been
                    hoped that the increase in net profits during the past twelve months would have
                    been devoted entirely to the reduction of the dues charged on vessels using the
                    Canal. The addition of 2 per cent. to the shareholders’ dividend knocks this
                    idea on the head, and if the present charge of 8.50 francs per ton is reduced to
                    7.75 francs shipowners will think themselves lucky, for the generosity of the
                    company may even fall short of this small concession. Indeed, I should not be
                    surprised if the reduction is only to 8 francs per ton. Such a decision might be
                    regarded with favor by some of the shareholders, but I fancy that in the end the
                    directors would regret their niggardliness.</p>
                <p>As to whether the redaction is likely to be maintained, a high authority in the
                    shipping world said to a Press representative last week: —-"In 1906 the Canal
                    Company are going to lose 10,000,000fr. in consequence of this reduction , and
                    it is a question whether or not such a loss can be continued. The company are
                    taking considerable risk in the interests of the shipping trade—certainly not in
                    the interest of their own shareholders.</p>
                <p>The proposed redaction is 75o. per ton, which is equal to a reduction of
                    10,000,000fr. or £400,000. The arrangement is just part and parcel of the London
                    programme, and is by no means in consequence of the agitation which was set on
                    foot a short time ago."</p>
                <p>On the other hand there are shipping authorities who hold the view that the 75c.
                    reduction is distinctly the outcome of the recent agitation.</p>
                <p>“At first," said one of these gentlemen to the representative, "they only talked
                    of a 25c. reduction, but, ultimately, a little sop of 75c. was suggested.</p>
                <p>"The company are paying 28 per cent dividend on the shares, which is a breach of
                    the London agreement All profit over 25 per cent., according to the terms of
                    that arrangement, ought to go to a reduction of the tonnage dues, and if that
                    were adhered to in all probability the rates would be brought down 2fr. or
                    3fr.</p>
                <p>"The agreement to which I refer was between M. de Lesseps on the one hand, and
                    the London Committee of Shipowners on the other. This is a clean, logical
                    agreement, and would, nodoubt, hold good at law. It is a great deal more than an
                    'honorable understanding.’</p>
                <p>"I learnt the other day from a gentleman of exceptionally high authority on these
                    matters that the only explanation which can be given for men like those at the
                    head of the Canal Company's affairs—including representatives of the British
                    Government—practically breaking their word, lies in the fact that they have
                    discovered that the London agreement, if adhered to, would place them in the
                    position of fiduciary legatees. Still, the code of honor that regulates private
                    firms should apply in the case of great companies.</p>
                <p>“The company might have come to the shipowners and said, ‘We are in a mess—we
                    must have this agreement altered.’ The shipowners, who have shown every
                    disposition to be reasonable, would, no doubt, have consented to discuss the
                    matter. Instead of that they have ridden rough-shod over everyone.</p>
                <p>“As to the enforcement of the agreement, where is the court to enforce it ? The
                    shipowners would have to go to France, and in an international affair of this
                    kind they ought to have their own Government with them. The Government, however,
                    at this time are sitting on the fence.”</p>

                <p>The new line to Alexandria is an extension of the Constanza-Constantinople-Athens
                    service. This route has lately been brought into prominence owing to the new
                    Constanza-Constantinople cable, which is of great economio importance. By this
                    means, telegraphic correspondence will be increased both between Berlin and Constantinople, on the one hand, and between Scutari,
                    Angora, Mossul, Baghdad, Basra, and Fao on the other.</p>
                <p>As regards mails, if the Constanza rente is adopted instead of the Brindisi line,
                    the distance will be considerably shortened between Europe and Asia Minor,
                    especially when the Baghdad railway is completed. There is now a rapid line of
                    steamers between Constanza and Constantinople, and the Roumanian Government

                <p>Mr. Paul Cavafy, who has been very greatly indisposed for some time past, is, we

                <p>The Malta correspondent of the "New York Herald," writing on Saturday week, says
                    :— A gloom has been cast over the island to-day by the death of Mrs. Balbi, wife
                    of Major Balbi, of the Royal Malta Artillery. Though she had only recently
                    arrived from Egypt, she had already become one of the best liked women in Malta.
                    Mrs. Balbi died of Mediterranean fever, after a very short illness.”</p>
