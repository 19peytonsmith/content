                        <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices of the 
                            Company's Agents.</p>
                        <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are intended to leave 
                            Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will 
                            meet the train to convey passengers to the ship.</p>
                        <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails arrive. 
                            Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                        <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the special train 
                            starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                        <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £ 22.9.11 Port Said to London via Brindisi 
                            or via Marseilles.</p>
                        <p>Passengers having paid full fare in one direction are allowed an abatement of 25 per 
                            cent on returning within 12 months.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about twice a fortnight 
                            of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                        <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                        <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for Australia
                            and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for Calcutta, fortnightly, and another 
                            for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port Said.</p>

                    <head>THE RISING IN THE FRENCH SUDAN.</head>
                    <p>"The Manchester Guardian" makes the following interesting comments on the trouble in the Sudan: 
                        The destruction of a French post in the Sudan makes it fairly certain that the British disaster 
                        near Sokoto was not an incident in any mere local rising. The nearest point on the French frontier 
                        is at least 150 miles distant from Sokoto, and though the boundary represents no racial division, 
                        a movement which affects French and English alike at points one or two hundred miles apart must be 
                        due to some widespread political discontent. A new Mahdi, it is said, has arisen in the Western Sudan. 
                        We hope that is not true; but the time, was fear, may be ripe for another movement like that which 
                        overthrew the Egyptian rule in the Sudan was an unmitigated curse, while the English and French in the 
                        Western Sudan have probably improved the well-being of the majority of their subjects. But the Egpytians, 
                        after all were Mahomedans, and the French and English are not. A second Mahdi might have to play on a 
                        different string from the first, but the tune might be just as terrible. Our political distinctions between 
                        the Egyptian Sudan, Nigeria, and the French Sudan correspond to no reality. The Sudan is best thought of as 
                        one vast country stretching from Sokoto on the west to Khartaum on the east, and from Kano on the south to 
                        Morocco, Algeria, and Tripoli on the north. There is constant communication over the whole of this vast district. 
                        Placards issued by the Mahdi who overthrew Egyptian rule in the Eastern Sudan were found posted in a street of Bida, 
                        two thousand miles west of Khartoum; and when Lord Kitchener began his reconquest of the Sudan, the Khalifa urged 
                        the Sultan of Sokoto to make a diversion in his favour by driving the Christians out of Nigeria. The pressure on 
                        this fanatical Mahomedan population in the Sudan has now for many years been kept up from several sides at once 
                        from the Egyptian Sudan on the east, from the Mediterranean downwards by France, and from the Gulf of Guinea upwards 
                        through Nigeria by England. Almost all the Mahomedan tribes have a common grievance, and if a counterstroke were 
                        attempted the only wonder would be that it had been delayed so long. The present movement may not turn out to be so 
                        serious, but, whether it is or not, a general rising of the Mahomedan tribes in the Sudan must always be accounted one 
                        of the permanent dangers to the Anglo-French settlement in North Africa. It would not be in the least fanciful to suspect 
                        some connection between the rising in Sokoto and the Conference of Algeciras.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH RULE IN CYPRUS.</head>
                    <p>The "Courrier European" publishes an article by M. S. Skiadaresis, giving an account of the condition of affairs in Cyprus. 
                        The writer asserts that British rule has not improved the economic condition of the island, but has, of anything, made it worse. 
                        He ascribes this failure, first, to the saddling of the island with the payment of the 93,000 per annum which England agreed to 
                        make over to Turkey by the Treaty of June 4th, 1878; second, to the costly administration by high-salaried British officials; 
                        and, third, to the wasteful and sometimes (as in the case of the recent railway construction totally mistaken way of carrying out 
                        public works. The writer acknowledges that now, on account of this failure on the part of the British to improve matters, 
                        there in the island a widespread national feeling in favour of anuexation to Greece, and he expresses the hope that the new High Commissioner, 
                        Sir Charles King-Harman, to whom he gives every credit for his generosity and consideration in treating the natives, may yet plead the 
                        cause of the Cypriots before his Government.</p>

                    <p>Over a year ago the management at Paris decided, in view of the growing prosperity of Egpyt, 
                        to come here, and the old residence of the Antoniadis family was secured on a twenty years' lease, 
                        at a rental of £2,000 a year. Since then the building has been entirely transformed and a large part 
                        of the garden has been converted into a large and airy counting house.</p>
                    <p>The transformation of the building into a bank has been most successful from an architectural point of view, 
                        and the general effect is excellent. Extensive strong rooms have been constructed below the bank. 
                        At the entrance there is a luxurious reception room for the convenience of the clients and other visitors, 
                        whilst the first floor is devoted to the Accounts Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Llewelyn, the manager, is to be congratulated on having so successfully achieved the difficult 
                        task of converting a private residence into a bank. The contractors were Messrs. 
                        Degiarde Brothers and this local firm has done some excellent work in making the building 
                        suitable for a large financial establishment.</p>
                    <p>The headquarters of the Comptoir will be at Alexandria, but a branch is also to be opened 
                        at Cairo in a few months' time.</p>

                    <p>THE FITZNER QUARTETTE</p>
                    <p>The second and last concert of the season was given by this quartette at the New Khedivial Hotel on Thursday night 
                        before a large audience. While it would be presumption to attempt to pass judgement upon the performance, 
                        which was as perfect of its kind as anything we have ever heard, the programme did not perhaps fulfill all 
                        the expectations that a casual perusal of its contents might naturally arouse. The first time, quartette by 
                        Volkmann, in G minor was a very beautiful example of what absolute sympathy and unanimity will do in a string 
                        quartette, the performers indeed not only giving the impression of being of one mind, but it almost seemed as 
                        if their instruments were swayed by one hand. The andante movement of this piece, especially with its swelling 
                        cadences relieved by occasional plaintive touches, and passages of syncopation introduced so cleverly as to avoid 
                        all possibility of abruptness or too marked a contrast, was delightful, and one was left, when this piece terminated, 
                        with a strong hope that there were things as good or even better to come. It was to be regretted, however, that this 
                        piece should have been immediately followed by a characteristic but not very enlivening Andante funebro by Tachaikowsky. 
                        We do not care to be reminded of funerals on the rare occasions that we go forth to luxuriate in the embraces of the 
                        fickle muse, even through the medium of such a master in the expression of the tragic in musical art as this composer. 
                        His tragedy has perhaps too much pessimism and too little grandeur to be always very satisfying. But the music of its 
                        kind was beautiful and one could detect occasional faint reminiscences of the famous "Pathetique" which made one feel 
                        at home. An Allegro vivo of Dvorak's came as a somewhat welcome relief. We now pass to the 'Beethoven' in A minor, 
                        an impressive but rather unintelligible work in four movements, the third movement in which takes the form of on ode 
                        written to a divinity in gratitude for a cure. It contains a beautiful chorale, with the tonic F, but in strict accordance 
                        with the moda in which it is written; the B in the scale is natural, and this would account for the rather unexpected 
                        harmonies this piece contained, which sometimes left one in doubt as to what the composer was driving at. It is one of 
                        the very rare examples of a piece written strictly in accordance with this ancient musical mode. By special request, 
                        at the end of the performance, a quartette of Griegs was given, and in this the performers surpassed themselves. 
                        No composer seems to combine genuine melody with a solid background of grand and impressive harmonies and this 
                        composer does, and the piece sent one home with a feeling of gratitude for a fitting termination to what had 
                        proved a regular festa of musical enjoyment.</p>

                    <p>The Coast Guard cruiser Nour el Bahr sailed from Suez yesterday morning for Akaba with Government stores and despatches 
                        for H.M.S. Diana, which is still anchored at Farson island to prevent the Turkish troops occupying it.</p>
                    <p>It is stated that at present the Turkish forces at Taba amount to about 5,000 men, with artillery.</p>
                    <p>It is quite certain that the first time the Nour el Bahr went to Akaba and sent out a boat with officers and men, 
                        the Turks refused to allow them to land, and ordered them to go back to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Turkish delegates for the frontier dispute, Colonel Muzaffer Pacha and Bimbashi Fehmy, have left Cairo for, it is 
                        said, Bayrout. It is surmised that they will start thence for Ma'an.</p>

                    <p>Lieut.-Gereral Fred. Lance writes to us from Luxor under date of 8atnrday: Yesterday afternoon about ten minutes 
                        to six o'olock, and a little time before the sun set behind tbe Theban hills, I was near the temple of Mut when 
                        I saw a brilliant meteor falling in a perpendicular direction. It disappeared behind a clump of palm trees. 
                        A gentleman and his daughter saw this meteor from tbe great pylon of the Temple of Karnak; from that point 
                        they state that they saw it burst laterally and disappear. They noticed the brilliancy of the meteor, especially 
                        at the time of bursting. As the appearance of a meteor in broad daylight is unusual it would be interesting to 
                        know whether the phenomenon was observed in other parts of Egypt.</p>

                    <p>We have had very unseasonable weather here lately. A few days ago we had a very bad dust storm which lasted all 
                        day and was most unpleasant. On the 15th, whilst we were at dinner, we had a little rain, which is very unusual 
                        here so early in the year. It has been very hot lately.</p>
                    <p>Major Ravenscroft and his new mufattish Mr. Geeve are up here. They have got a lot of good recruits for the Slavery 
                        Repression Department and are busy training them. The former leaves for Cairo in a few days.</p>
                    <p>Several new buildings are in course of erection and are badly needed.</p>
                    <p>We have great festivities during the visit of the Bishop of Hereford here, including parties, assault-at-arms, and a 
                        football match between the 8th and 12th Battalions at which the Bishop kicked off.</p>

                        Cromer, will not, (the "Tribune" hears), be at Mongalla, which has just been safely reached, but at a point much lower 
                        down the river. Thirty years ago the necessity for such a mission was urged by General Gordon. The first tribes to be 
                        approached are the Dinkas, a warlike and savage people. Dr. Albert Cook, who arrived from Uganda some weeks in advance 
                        of the pioneer bands, found that Mongalla was not the most favourable spot for commencing work. It is interesting to 
                        note that the missionaries received help from the Commandant at Fashoda, who sent his steamer to tow

                    <p>ABYSSINIANS GAIN THE DAY.</p>
                    <p>Jerusalem, February 24.</p>
                    <p>A dispute of long standing between the Abyssinians and Copts, dating as far back as tho middle of last century, regarding 
                        the ownership of the convent called 'Deir es Sultan," adjacent to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, for which question 
                        the Emperor Menelik has sent of late years two special missions to the Sultar, accompanied with costly and rare presents, 
                        has at last been adjusted to the satisfaction of the Abyssinians. His Excellency Rechid Bey, the Governor of Jerusalem, 
                        acting under orders from the Sublime Porte, has this day caused a separate entrance to the said convent to be opened with 
                        a view of handing over its key to General Machachs, the head of the Abyssinian Mission, who has recently returned from Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>The Sultan had a short time previously issued an Imperial Irade to the effect that the Copts should be called upon to cede to the 
                        Abyssinisns a duplicate key of the old door of the convest in question, but the Coptic Bishop of Jerusalem persisted in declining to 
                        carry out the request of the Imperial 'Government or to grant any concession whatsoever. In order to avoid using compulsion, the Governor, 
                        who acted throughout with tact and moderation suggested, and tbe Porte concurred, that instead of a duplicate key being given by the 
                        Copts a separate gateway to the convent might be opened from the street for the use of the Abyssinan, who from ancient times have been 
                        inhabiting the said monastery. Thus the site becomes now practically the property of both sects.</p>
                    <p>In former time, the Abyssinians, acoording to hints in eccleaiastical history, had considerable possessions within the Holy City, of 
                        which they have been deprived, so that there remained only the convent of "Deir es Sultan" above referred to (in which there are at 
                        present about 70 Abyssinian monks and pilgrim) which the Copts have been claiming as their own, alleging that the Abyssinians were 
                        admitted therein on sufferance, owing to their being in intercommunion with them. In fact, the Copts have been the masters of the 
                        place since tbe door was under their control, and the inmates were locked in or allowed exit whenever they chose. The Abyssinians, 
                        on the other hand, could not prove by documentary evidence that the convent really belonged to them, for, in 1839, at the time of 
                        the Egyptian occupation of Syria, it happened that all the Abyssinians in Jerusalem died at plague and their library, containing 
                        many valuable manuscripts, was then entirely burnt by Ibrahim Pacha, at the instigation of the Armenians under the pretext of 
                        danger of infection, with all the documents which might have served them to recover their property in these better times. 
                        At any rate Dr. Gobat, once Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem, in a statement made by him on this question in 1852, wrote: "I have 
                        myself seen the library 25 years ago together with such documents, and that all those books and documents were consigned to 
                        the flames on the aforesaid occasion is most notorious in Jerusalem."</p>
                    <p>It will not be without interest to mention in this connection that in 1866, when King Theodorus of Abyssinia detained in 
                        captivity within his dominions a number of Englishmen, which culminated in a British expedition against his country, 
                        that monarch alleged that his action was a retaliation for the indifference displayed by England to his repeated appeals 
                        to the British Government for the recovery of the "Deir-es-Sultan" convent from the Copts, and in consequence of that 
                        statement the question of that monastery formed the subject of a special Blue Book, which was laid before Parliament in 1867.</p>

                    <p>Many are the reasons given for facilitating by rail and road the communications between Cairo and Helonan, and yet all things 
                        considered Helonan would lose its chief charms if it were brought into closer touch with the noise and bust of the big city and 
                        became merged into a mere suburb. As it stands now its chief joys are to be found in its perfect peace and rest, its glorious air, 
                        and the simplicity of life, all of which would become impossible if it ever became merely the annexe to crowded Cairo. From time 
                        to time the greater world swarms into it but for the moot part tbe visitors spend their days in healthy open air pursuits and their 
                        nights in health-giving repose, and there are but few who would change their lot for tbe attractions of tbe social merry-go 
                        round of the hub of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Social Gatherings.</p>
                    <p>Not that one need forswear society altogether in Helonan, for many are tbe gatherings, race meetings, dances, and entertainments which 
                        are provided by and for the more energetic and these are always well attended insomuch that visitors have not tbe same chance of being 
                        satisfied by a plethora of them. The Casino was very full on Thursday evening when an excellent company of amateurs gave a very 
                        successful entertainment in aid of the organ fund for tbe English Church. Theatricals are always a great attraction, and Mrs. Warren, 
                        Miss Hobson, and Miss Tottenham did their best for the littte comedietta "Petticoat Perfidy," which was the first item of the programme. 
                        One could have wished to see these ladies in some other characters, for they had but little plot and next to no humour. Mrs. Warren made 
                        a charming little French maid, and spoke her lines prettily enongh when her voice got used to the stage; but Miss Tottenham's part was 
                        uncongenial, nor was Miss Hobson's role a sympathetic one. Mr. Trimen gave a couple of good comic songs, notably a mock passionate love 
                        song with its refrain "Mingle your eyebrows with mine, love," whioh called forth an encore, and Mr. Hans Sawyer, who is an elocutionist 
                        of no little merit, gave a very successful and amusing "Engine driver's story" with local allusions.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Jarley's Waxworks.</p>
                    <p>The second half of the evening's entertainment was given over to the performance of Mrs. Jarley's Waxworks, that celebrated showwoman being 
                        impersonated by Mr. Madden, while Mr. Hans Sawyer made a most praiseworthy George. The vargaries of the "waxworks" and their mechanical 
                        irresponsibilities and breakdowns were very cleverly rendered, and tbe witticisms of Mrs. Jarley and George were at times exceedingly to 
                        the point. Much praise is due to the figure for their actions and utterances, Miss Tottenham being especially clever in her wooden movements 
                        and incontrollable actions. Mr. Charlesworth played his part of a very "SimpleSimon" and Mr. Lord made an excellent "Fat Joe." "Mary and her 
                        lamb," and "Bopeep" never looked prettier than when enacted by Visa L Zahotkine and Miss Bentley respectively, and Miss Babbington Jones' 
                        voice as "Signs Squallina" will not easily be forgotten. Mr. Ford made many great hits as a "Professional Golfer," and Miss Zabotkine as the 
                        "Baby on the Shore" had the sympathy of the entire house when she was brought to bay under an empty crate at the termination of the proceedings. 
                        It is estimated that about £50 has been made by the entertainment, and if so it will not be long before the church is in possession of the 
                        organ it so badly requires.</p>
                    <p>Race Meeting.</p>
                    <p>The race meeting today brought together the usual number of people and proved a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon but for the unfortunate mishap 
                        that caused Mr. Michaeli does a nasty spill during the last race. He had been more than usually lucky during the earlier afternoon and most 
                        people would have been glad to see him score another win. Among those noticed in the enclosure were Mr. and Mrs. Satow, the Misses Hurley, 
                        Miss Fullerton, Mrs. Smart, Mrs. Freeman, Dr. Graf, Mr. Payne, Miss Wait, the Hon. F. Morgan, Mr. Draper, Mr. Reid, Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, 
                        Mr. Doherty, Mrs. Shepperd, Capt. and Miss Morgan, Mr. and Mrs. Huteson, Mrs. and the Misses Bentley, Major Watson, Mrs. Warren, Major and 
                        Mrs. Wynne, Capt. Outram, Miss Darley, Miss Duncan, Mr. Lord, Mrs. Hopkinson, Mr. Carter-Wilson, Col. Sparkes, Aziz Pacha Izzat, Ahmed Bey

                    <p>Lady Cromer and her sister, Lady Beatrice Thynne, her son, the Hon. Evelyn Baring, and suite have returned to Cairo from Mena House, 
                        where the air has done the young child a deal of good, the weather being at its best now at Mena.</p>
                    <p>Three birthdays of prominent Anglo-Egyptians feel last week. Lord Cromer was born on the Feb. 26, 1841, Rear Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield 
                        on March 3, 1835, and Judge Marshall on the same day in 1864.</p>
                    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Brodrick and Miss Sybil Brodrick after their visit to Egypt will probably go to India. About a year ago it seemed possible 
                        that Mr. Brodrick would go to India under very different circumstances. Unless rumour was quite wrong, Mr. Baltour was on the point of 
                        recommending the appointment of Mr. Brodrick to be Lord Curson's successor as Viceroy of India. It such was his intention it came to 
                        nought, for the cabled rumour roused such opposition in India, as well as at home that Mr. Brodrick's chance was gone.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Anderson Fowler, one of the pioneers in the packing industry and for many years the president of the Anglo-American Packing &amp; 
                        Provision Company, has died while touring Egpyt. Two other members of the Fowler family died from diseases contracted in Egpyt, Robert E. 
                        Fowler and the Rev. James W. Fowler, brothers of Andesen Fowler, being poisoned by the drinking water.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fowler leaves an estate estimated at $15,000,000 to be distributed among the widow and nine children. The property consists of large 
                        holdings of timber lands in the South and West. Mr. Fowler was in the packing business for more than 30 years. In 1902, he sold out to 
                        the National Packing Company. Mr. Fowler was 53 years old. For the last 15 years he had lived in New York.</p>

                    <p>NOTES FROM SUEZ.</p>
                    <p>RETURN OF H.M.S. DONEGAL.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Suez, Sunday.</p>
                    <p>H. M.'s first-class cruiser Donegal, which was ashore at Tor Bank, in the Suez Gulf, was refloated, as I informed you by wire, last 
                            Friday evening, and as she sustained very slight damage she apparantly must have proceeded. She is bound for China and will call 
                            at Aden, Colombo, and Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>The British homeward-bound steamer Ratho has been ashore in the Canal, between 152 Kilo. station and Port Tewfik, since early 
                            this morning and is blocking the way. All traffic is stopped.</p>
                    <p>The Khedivial mail liner Rahmanieh arrived at Suez yesterday from Tor with a large number of Egpytian pilgrims, who are the 
                            first to return. The health of the pilgrims is good.</p>
                    <p>Suez, Later.</p>
                    <p>The S.S. Ratho has been refloated this afternoon with the assistance of the Canal Company's tug Titan.</p>
                    <p>Suez, Monday.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Donegal has returned to Suez this morning.</p>
