                <p>To the many and eminent services which Lord Roberts has rendered to his country
                    he has now added another by throwing all the weight of hie authority and
                    experience into an effort to arouse the public to a sense of the dangerous
                    inefficiency of the land defences of the Empire. It is an encouraging symptom
                    that his previous utterances on this vital subject led the London Chamber of
                    Commerce to invite him to address a special meeting, for which the Mansion-house
                    was placed at disposal by the Lord Mayor. These is always good hope of a
                    movement which interests the City of London to this extent, and we trust that
                    his reception may not only convince Lord Roberts that he is producing an effect
                    upon public opinion, but may lead other important public bodies to lend their
                    aid. much of the difficulty of his task arises from the dual nature of the
                    problem of Imperial defence. The public are accustomed to think of the British
                    Army as an organisation maintained at vast expense lor the purpose chiefly of
                    sending regular drafts to India, occasionally carrying on small frontier wars
                    with turbulent tribes in various parts of the world, and pro viding a second
                    line of defence for these islands. There is endless discussion of the
                intelligently conducted, either by military men or by the public. It resolves
                    itself too</p>
                <p>often into a mere shuffling about of Regulars, Militia, and Volunteers, each of
                    which has its convinced advocates always regarding the others with a jealousy
                    which is fatal to progress. The essential limitations of all three are.
                    continually ignored. About our Regular Army, the cardinal fact is that it is a
                    voluntary army, which has to go into the labour market for recruits, and that
                    taking one year with another the number of useful recruits may be put at about
                    30,000. Army reformers may be clever, though sometimes they are not, but were
                    they gifted with absolute genius they could not make 30,000 men into anything
                    more than thirty thousand. They are always trying experiments and putting forth
                    schemes which one and all involve the hopeless attempt to make that number do
                    duty for a larger one. The Militia and Volunteers are counted in and scored out
                    again, pretty much as an Oriental jeweller makes a solid ring mostly consisting
                    of base metal, dissolves-out the bare metal, and has for remainder a ring
                    indeed, but one which is no stronger than the original gold which suffices to
                    form it.</p>
                <p>There is another aspect of Imperial defence which all this peddling puts out of
                    sight altogether. Even if the Army were made thorough-ly adequate for the
                    purposes we have named, there would remain the question what we are to do in
                    case our possessions are attacked by one of the gigantic armies of modern days,
                    drawn by conscription from populations often greatly outnumbering our own. When
                    we have counted up everything that has ever stood in front of a sergeant, we
                    have nothing adequate for such a contest The Norfolk Commission, we have no
                    doubt quite rightly, has declared that neither Militia nor Volunteers are fit to
                    face the thoroughly trained soldiers of States that put most of the population
                    through the ranks. Were they fit they could not be compelled to go abroad, and
                    were they compelled to go there is no organisation or equipment fitted for a
                    serious war. Taking such forces as are usually contemplated in a vague way
                    without question of their actual efficiency, Lord Roberts tells us that for
                    serious work, say on the frontier of India, there would be a shortage of 7,000
                    officers. The medical service would not suffice for 100,000 men in real war
                    against a civilised foe. Men of sorts could perhaps be scraped together, as in
                    the Boer war, to the number of 350,000, but that was the limit of our resources
                    even with unfit material, while in a serious war we should need to put in the
                    fighting line quite that number of trained soldiers and then furnish extensive
                    reserves and reinforcements. That is the aspect of Imperial defence to which
                    Lord Roberts desired to call attention when he said in the House of Lords that
                    the British Army is no better prepared for war than before the South African
                    troubles began. He had no thought of denying that reforms have been made in such
                    Army as we have, but he was speaking of that larger Imperial defence for which
                    we have made no preparations that can be regarded as serious.</p>
                <p>Now what are the preparations which he regards as serious and possible. Not an
                    army of conscripts, which he regards as unsuited to the conditions of this
                    country, though that would be preferable to total unpreparedness wants universal
                    training in drill and in shooting, carried out in all sorts of ways to suit all
                    conditions of men. That would give us a population out of which we could form
                    efficient soldiers in large numbers, with the very short preparation which the
                    Japanese have found adequate, thanks to the practical efficiency of their
                    education. What harm would it do to divert some of the energies of our
                    schoolboys from games into the path of ordered exercises, which would fit them
                    in a great emergency to save the Empire! What harm would it do the classes from
                    which officers are drawn so to modify their education and their amusements as to
                    make them embryo officers! Drill for everybody, familiarity with a rifle for
                    everybody, and higher education as applied to war for all who possess superior
                    intelligence would do nothing bnt good all round. No one surely can look upon
                    the crowds of slouching figures to be seen in our streets without thinking what
                    a pity it is that they were not taught at school to hold themselves erect. No
                    one can consider the mental slouch of so many of his fellow beings without
                    regretting that they were never taught alertness and discipline. What was begun
                    in school would be willingly carried on afterwards. We should have real
                    Volunteers with real officers; and we should have a hundred for one. The talk
                    about militarism is cant. A citizen army never fights for the fun of it
                    Militarism is the vice of an army irresponsibly governed, or of an army of
                    citizens who have no voice in their own affairs. Besides, with a population
                    trained as Lord Roberts desires, and treated afterwards as it would demand to be
                    treated, we should inspire abroad a kind and degree of respect which would go
                    far to curb the ambitions of militarism everywhere.</p>
