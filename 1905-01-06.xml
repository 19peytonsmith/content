                    <head> SUDAN TRADE AND TRADE
                ROUTES </head>
                <p> Some interesting reflections are suggested
                by the article on Sudan trade in another
                column of today's issue. In any arrangements
                for the development of trade, railways most
                always take a prominent place, and so much
                has beenhbeard of the Red Sea-Nile Railway
                that it may perhaps not be inopportune to
                enquire into the relative advantages offered by
                this route as against the present means of
                communication via Alexandria, Port Said, and
                Suez. We do not intend to touch upon the
                Political aspect of the question, other than to
                say that both the harbour and railway works
                are a natural consquence of a settled and far-
                scing administration, and that similarly to
                the building of the line from Haifa to Khar-
                toum, so will the completion of this project
                remain a tribute to the prompter and to
                the executors concerned in the undertaking.</p>
                <p> Looking, however, to immediate results, say
                for the five years following on the opening
                of the line, it promises no commercial advan-
                tages over the existing route. On the contrary,
                the freight will be higher and the duration of
                the journey longer. Liverpool and London
                steamers ask 15s. more per ton to Sualin than
                to Alexandria and stipulate transhipment at
                the latter port Antwerp lines demand 55 frs
                per ton in addition to the ordinary rate to
                Alexandria. The Austrian Lloyd hand their
                goods for Suakin over to the Khedivial Line
                at Port Said, the Khedivial vary naturally
                retaining two-thirds of the total rate from
                Trieste to Suakin. Only vessels occasionally
                carrying full Government cargo, perhaps
                also the Florio-Rubattino Line, will call
                direct at Suakin, and it will be years before
                inland trade and commerce will be remune-
                rative enough to render Sheikh Barghoot
                a regular port of call. It is expected that
                some of the Abyssinian trade miy be diverted
                towards Suakin, but apparently the Austrian
                Lloyd do not share this opinion, as they are
                making arrangements to develop Abyssinian
                traffic via Tadjurs Bay and to establish
                a regular line through that channel. Nor
                in the matter of the export of gum can Suakin
                compete with Sues in facilities. At the latter
                port all homeward-bound vessels have to call for
                provisions, to land and embark passengers, and
                to unload their heavy cargoes for distribution
                all over Egypt In order to replete their holds,
                they practically take in gum at ballast rates
                and for all destinations. It is, further, not
                to be overlooked that fully half of this staple
                product is taken up by Cairo dealers, who as-
                sort and otherwise handle the gum at Cairo
                before reshipment.</p>
                <p> In a spirit of competition, Nile navigation
                companies can always afford to further
                lower their rates for gum as well as for general
                merchandise via Alexandria and Halfa, and
                the Egyptian Railways Administration may
                also see its way to make a reduction rather
                than forego the business altogether. The
                remark has been thrown out that the railway
                rate between the junction at Damer or Berber
                to Halfa could be increased, but one can hardly
                credit the authorities as being keen on such
                an artificial measure, which would be more
                productive of harm than good, and little likely
                to attain the object desired.</p>
                <p> As for tourists, Suakin is of no consequences,
                unless some travellers from India care to “do"
                the Sudan and Egypt from that point; but few
                firat-class steamers could afford to call unless
                they carried a fair number of passengers booked
                in that direction, and that is very questionable.
                The risks generally, to both passengers and
                freight, are greater via Suakin than by the
                Nile route, and the journey is rougher and
                longer. Cotton exports, too, can be rele-
                gated for consideration beyond the tens
                of our review. There will be nothing of any
                magnitude for another five years at least
                For the Public Works, however, the new line
                should prove both convenient and economical,
                as also for the import of heavy and bulky mater-
                ials of all descriptions. A great impetus will
                necessarily be given to the conveyance and
                introduction of Bengal coal. The fuel question,
                in fact, appears to be an argent matter, but
                that again is primarily for Government re-
                quirements. This is of no momentary interest
                to the public at large, nor will it be till the
                time when there is a free supply of water
                for irrigation purposes. The main feature
                therefore of the Suakin harbour and railway is
                concentrated in the fact of their being the
                earnest commencement of a network of public
                works in the country, of which this will famish
                a most important link.</p>

            <p>We are glad to be able to announce that the
            excitement which prevailed yesterday among
            the "abonnes" of the Alexandria and Ramlah
            Railway has in a great measure subsided, and
            the various sentiments, ranging from wild
            defiance to passive but indignant submission,
            have now given way to a conviction that we
            are within measurable distance of a peaceful
            settlement of the question. The public is
            awaiting with great interest the results of this
            afternoon's deliberations of the board of direc-
            tors of the company, which will meet at 4
            o'clock, when a decision will be arrived at in
            regard to the establishment of a definite tarif
            which will satisfy the legitimate demands of
            the public. Boghos Pasha Nubar, the chairman
            of the company, is now on his way from Cairo
            to attend this afternoon's meeting.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>THE POLICE AND THB PUBLIC</head>
            <p>Throughout yesterday morning a posse of
            the Alexandria City Police remained at the
            Alexandria terminus of the line and a large
            number of “proces verbaux” were drawn np
            against recalcitrant Ramlehites who insisted
            on travelling without paying their fares. A
            climax was reached shortly after noon, when a
            scene of considerable excitement ensued, as large
            numbers of the Ramlehites were flocking to
            the terminus in order to get home to their mid-
            day meal. Some of them showed signs of defiance
            and tried to pass through the gates without
            tickets in spite of the efforts of the police.
            They forced the police cordon and made for
            the cars with a rush. They succeeded in
            boarding the cars and triumphantly got off to
            Ramleh without having to submit to the
            exactions of the company.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>THE TENSION IS RELIEVED.</head>
            <p>At 2 p.m. the company, seeing that the
            presence of the police appeared to aggravate
            the exasperated feelings of the Ramlahites,
            asked the Commandant, Miralai Hopkinson
            Bey, to withdraw his men from the station.
            This was done and the wise step appeared to
            greatly relieve the feeling of extreme tension.
            Immediately afterwards the delegates of the
            Ramlehites distributed the following</p></div>

            was felt that the most acute stage of the crisis
            had been passed, and the excitement that had
            hitherto prevailed began to gradually fizzle
            away, to be replaced by more calm feelings. We
            are happy to state that the attitude of both
            is becoming more and more conciliatory and
            the feeling appears to be gradually gaining
            ground that some modus vivendi will be ulti-
            mately discovered, for there is no doubt that
            the new tarif cannot be maintained. A
            a sign of the improvement in the outlook,
            we may mention that the company did
            not make any application for extra police
            this morning at the Alexandria terminus,
            which has resumed its wonted peaceful ap-
            pearance.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>A MASS MEETING</head>
            <p>of Ramlehites has been convened for to-morrow
            evening by the delegates. It will begin at 9 p.m.
            and will be held at the Bacos Theatre. The
            results of the deliberations of the board of di-
            rectors will be carefully and judicially taken
            into consideration, and in all probability a
            happily adjusted compromise will be arrived at.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>PETITION TO THE AUTHORITIES.</head>
            <p>The Committee appointed for the defence
            of the interests of Ibrahimieh and Ramleh has
            addressed the following letter to the Minster
            of Public Works, a copy of which has been
            sent to Lord Cromer and H.E. the Governor of
            Alexandria, as president of the Municipal
            Commission:—</p>
            <p>Excellence,</p>
            <p>Nous avons l'honneur, au nom des habitants
            de l'Ibrahimieh et Ramleh d'appeler la bien veil-
            lante attention de V. E. sur la grave situation
            dans laquelle se trouve la population de ces
            deux localites par suite des agissements de
            l'Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Co. Ld.</p>
            <p>Le service de cette Compagnie est vital pour
            Ramleh et Imbrahimieh qui ont environ 20,000
            habitants et comprennent 3750 maisons
            payent L.E.7,881 d'impot par an.</p>
            <p>Le service de traction entre Alexandrie et
            Ramleh fut assume par l’A &amp; R.R. Co. Ld, en
            date du 28 Juin 1883 et ensuite un nouveau
            contrat fut paste entre le Ministere des Tre-
            vaux Publics et cette Compagnie le 17 Julliet
            1890 suivant copie ci-incluse.</p>
            <p>Quand la concession initiale fut accordee en
            1860, Ramleh etait presque on desert et il est
            concevable que l’on ne se soit pas preoccupe
            d'imposer a la Compagnie un Cahier des
            Charges.</p>
            <p>Aujourd'hui Ramleh a pris un developpe-
            ment considerable et il est de toute necessite
            que ce Cahier des Charges soit impose a une
            Compagnie faisant un service publiq de cette
            importance.</p>
            <p>Nous passons outre les inconvenients dont
            Ramleh et l’Ibrahimieh ont longuemeut souf-
            fert par suite de ce manque d’un Cahier des
            Charges et nous nous limitons a enumerer a
            V.E. les privileges exorbitants dont jouit la
            Compagnie.</p>
            <p>Elle peut a son gre :</p>
            <p>Elever ou abaisser les prix de transport,creer
            dos tarifs d'abonnement, les supprimer.</p>
            <p>Modifier les horaires; suspendre ou ajoumer
            les departs.</p>
            <p>Allonger ou diminuer la duree du trajet.</p>
            <p>Creer des gares ou des stations ou bon lui
            semble ; les changer de place, les supprimer.</p>
            <p>Fournir un materiel mal dispose et de qualite
            mediocre.</p>
            <p>Augmenter ou supprimer le nombre de voi-
            tures en service.</p>
            <p>Faire servir une voie ferree etablie pour des
            locomotives et de lourds wagons a des voitures
            legeres qui cahotent d'une facon permanente.</p>
            <p>La seule enumeration de ces privileges,
            ajoutes au droit de menopole, demontrers a
            V.E. qu'il est urgent, en presence des reclama-
            tions unanimes d’une population irritee, de
            prendre les mesures necessaires pour mettre un
            trein au principal souci des actionnaires qui
            est l'augmentatation des dividendes.</p>
            <p>Il resulte de ces privileges que la Compagnie
            peut d'un trait de plume faire hauseer ou
            baisser les prix des terrains et des maisons de
            Ramleh et de l'Ibrahimieh, qu'elle peut ruiner
            des quartiers populeux; quelle peut modifier
            a son gre le budget de depenses de toute une
            population, et o’est precisement ce qu'elle vient
            de faire a la date du 1er Janvier de cette
            annee.</p>
            <p>Elle a etabli que les abonnees de 1re Classe
            qui payaient P.T. 950 par an paieront a raison
            de 120 voyages par mois a Mill 15 environ
            P.T. 2200. Ceux de 3me Classe qui payaient
            P.T. 570 par an paieront P.T. 1100.</p>
            <p>Ce tarif est prohibitif pour la classe la plus
            nombreuse d’abonnes dont beaucoup devront
            renoncer a habiter Ramleh tout en y ayant des
            proprietes.</p>
            <p>Une simple oomparaison :</p>
            <p>Les abonnements des Chemins de Fer Egyp-
            tiens pour la ligne de Matarieh, qui est a tres
            pen de chose pres, de la meme longueur que
            celle de Ramleh, sont bien interieurs a ceux de
            l'A. &amp; R. R. Co. Ld.</p>
            <p>En effet l'abonnoment en premiere coute
            L.E. 8 et en seconde L.E. 6 par an.</p>
            <p>Dans ces conditions nous venons prier le
            Gouvernment, qui protege impartialement
            tous ses administers d'user des droits que lui
            confere la concession du 6 sout 1860 pour
            imposer a la Compagnie un Cahier des Charges
            analogue a celui des autres Compagnies de
            traction electrique, portant sur les points que
            nous vous avons signales et sur toutos les
            questious d'ordre public.</p>
            <p>Dans le cas ou la Compagnie s'y refuserait,
            l'article 6 de la concession initiale auquel nous
            nous referons et qui, pensons-nous, conserve
            toute sa force, donne le droit au Gouvernement
            “de retirer sa concession a toute epoque sauf a
            indemniser la Compagnie des travaux executes
            a dire d’experts."</p>
            <p>Nous espersons que V.E. voudra bien prendre
            a couer les interets d'une nombreuse fraction
            de la population d'Alexandrie et d'une plage

            <head>CABRERA.</head>
            <p>The fourth performance of Dupont's Cabrera
            last evening proved a great success. Siga.
            Pinto, it goes without saying, again distinguish-
            ed hereolf as Amalia, and was well seconded by
            Sig. Bravi, the tenor. The latter possesses a
            voice of very fine timbre and delightful fresh-
            ness, but rather light for an opera such as
            Cabrera. The performance of a portion of
            Don Pasquale met with a similar success.
            To-morrow, Siberia will be staged.</p></div>

            excellent performance of Lucia di Lammer-
            moor on Wednesday night. Signore Svicher
            thoroughly deserved the applause given her,
            especially for her song in Act II. Signori
            Pagani, Badini, and Baldelli all showed to
            great advantage. We were glad to note that
            the house was well filled and we hope that
            the fears of a Cairo correspondent will prove
            unjustified, though we cordially agree with his
            remarks and hope that Cairo in general will
            appreciate them and will give the Verdi Thea-

            Egypt in a few months' time and will start
            operations at Alexandria. Mr. P. Llewellyn,
            formerly manager of the French Bank of Brazil
            at Rio de Janeiro, has been sent, here by the
            Comptoir National to make all the necessary
            preparations and will assume the management
            of the branch here.</p>
            <p>Mr. Llewellyn was at the Credit Lyonnais
            at Alexandria some years ago, where he was a
            "fonde de pouvoirs." A branch will probably

            <p>Perfect arrangements and organisation
            were manifest at the ball given at Shepheard's

            no crowding, though a great proportion of
            the 800 invited appeared, the floor of the great
            dining-room was very good, and the supper
            arrangements and buffet were up to the standard
            set by all the other accessories. The decora-
            tions, toilettes, and uniforms made a very
            striking picture, and the dancing was as ani-
            mated as it could be, while the Bracale or-
            chestra played in period time. Of course, the
            cotillon was the event of the evening and was led
            by Mme. Adolphe Cettaui and M. Ferdinand
            de Martino, with all the grace and skill that
            the occasion—and it was a great occasion—
            demanded. After the conclusion of the
            “official programme” the dancers began again

            <p>(From our Financil Correspondent)</p>
            <p>London, December 30.</p>
            <p>The Stock Markets are so closely associated
            with political matters that we most crave
            indulgence if from time to time we refer to
            the latter. Those who look ahead are not at
            all happy as to the outcome of the finan-
            cial position in Russia. Another loan for
            £25,000,000 is on the eve of being launched,
            report says on the 12th January-this time in
            Berlin—4 1/2 per cent. Bonds at 95. This will
            materially increase the weight of the prodi-
            gious "Baby'' now resting on "Dame Europe's”
            lap. France, and her neighbor are so heavily
            involved that they cannot afford to let the
            issue be anything but a so-called success. If
            it were not for this we do not suppose Russia
            would be able to obtain within 20 or 30 points
            of this price for the issue. The cost of the war
            to Russia has so far been estimated at 100
            millions, but we know from sad experience
            that these estimates are well below the mark,
            and that the real figure is generally nearly
            double. With the internal troubles increasing
            throughout the country, the Russian Govern-
            ment will be having its hands full at home as
            well as abroad. The peace negotiations are for
            the moment going slow—so that altogether
            one is not surprised if the old posesores in the
            financial world are inclined to shake their grey
            beads in an ominous fashion. The general
            tone of the market is wonderfully firm,
            exceptionally so far the end of the year.
            South Africans look like opening the New
            Year with higher prices. All the leading pro-
            perties good and hold their prices well
            although business is small at present. The
            Continent has been a persistent buyer of Gold-
            fields. The break in cotton which has
            resulted from over-production in America
            caused a sharp set-back in Egyptian
            Stocks yesterday, Bank shares especially drop-
            ping back nearly a point from Wednesday's
            closing prices, Agriculturals opening 9, and
            Nationals 22. There was some support at
            these prices and a consequent recovery of
            about 1/2 in both cases which is fully maintained.
            Delta Lands, in spite of the forthcoming
            increase of capital by £150,000, keep their
            price well at 2 1/2, and Dairy Sugar remain firm
            and are likely to go higher. There has been
            some demand for Nile Land and Agricultural
            Co.'s shares which stand at about 8, but there is
            little or no free market in them at present.
            Corporation of Western Egypt shares are being
            quoted at a premium, but sotive deal-
            ings cannot be looked for until the turn of the
            New Year. Egyptian Mines are a shade
            steadier, although Nile Valley shares are
            rather dull in tendency, doe to the fact that
            the jobbers did not consider the annual meet-
            ing as satisfactory as it might been.
            Americans are firm again. Consols are dis-
            tinctly good, and investment stocks are all
            firmer, the chief factor being cheap money.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>L'ABOLITION DES CAPITULATIONS.</head>
            <p>Dans sa lettre ouverte a MM. les membres
            de la commission de la reforme des Tribunaux
            Mixtes, publiee dans le No. 23 de son journal
            arabe El Mounnem, mon eminent confrere et
            ami, M. Loatfi bey Ayrout, a exprim4 un desir
            qui fermentait depuis longtemps dans le sein
            de la majorite desinteressee de la population de
            l'Egypte. On ne saurait trop insister sur le
            bien fonde de la theorie qu’il a soulevee.</p>
            <p> Il est interessant de remonter a ce propos a
            l'origine des Tribonaux de la reforme. Dans
            son projet de 1867, adresse aux puissances,
            Nubar Pacha demandait pour lee nouveaux
            Tribunaux le droit de connaitre de toutes les
            infractions commises par les Europeans, quelle
            que soit leur nature; il demandait, en principe,
            l’abrogation complete des capitulations.</p>
            <p>La commission qui sieges a Paris du 8
            Novembre au 3 Decembre 1867 reconnut, dans
            sa decision, la necessite d’obtenir en Egypte
            l'unitfe de legislation et de juridiction; elle
            approuva l’etabllisement des tribunaux mixtes,
            mais elle refuse une competence aussi etendue
            que celle proposee dans le rapport de Nubar.
            Neanmoins, celui-ci ne se decourages pas et en
            Nfianmoins, oelnl-ci ne se dfioouragea pas ettrn
            1869 obtint la reunion au Cairo d’une Commis-
            sion internationale chargee d'etudier le projet.</p></div>
