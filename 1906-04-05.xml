                <div type="item"> <head>The Housing of Officials</head>
                    <p>The Government has decided to make an experiment of a decidedly bold character in housing its higher officials. An official commu- nication to the Press, after mentioning the inadequacy of the house accommodation now existing at Cairo, and the consequent embar¬rassments of officials with fixed incomes whose rents have been raised often to prohibitive figures, states that the Ministry of Finance has decided to proceed forthwith to the construc- tion of a few experimental houses at Ghezireh to be let to Government servants at rents representing an adequate return on the capital expended. The rents, from £150 to £200 per annum in the case of the houses and from £100 to £120 in the case of two sets of flits, will of course be beyond the means of any bat the better-paid officials. The. Government is aware that the experiment will not benefit the smaller ' officials, and expresses the hope that private enterprise will supply their needs, and makes special reference in this connection to the Abbassieh Oasis Co., which has bean granted a concession on very favourable terms for the creation of a suburb beyond Ahbassieh. Should all else fail the Government will be compelled to consider what steps can be taken to ensure a (equate housing accommodation for this class of its servants. The proposal has been criticised with great severity by the greater part of the - European and native Press, and we believe it s to be regarded with disfavour by a large num¬ber of educated Europeans and natives, among them many officials, who consider that the smaller officials and those occupying an in¬termediate position, whose embarrassments from the deficiency of suitable houses and from high rents are proportionately greater, should have been the first to benefit from any such scheme on the part of the State.
                    </p><p>We are quite ready to admit that the higher an official’s pay the greater the jealousy with which he is regarded, and that this sentiment may have inspired some of the criticism which has been bestowed on the scheme. But we consider that the authorities have not examined the scheme from the point of view of the man who will not benefit by it. If an official, he will argue that the embarrass¬ments of men earning from £800 to £2000 a year are as nothing to those of the function¬aries earning half or less than half of those amounts. If his temper is at all unangelic he will probably go farther and speak of favour-itism, with gestures and epithets, inspired by his irritation. Now we do not share the opinion of our hypothetical official, but we do consider that before taking this step the Government might have taken the public into its confidence. It would then have realised that the scheme was not likely to prove popular with any but a very limited class of public servants. As it is the authorities seem tons to have spoiled a good scheme by beginning at the wrong end. We quite understand that the general rise of prices and the lack of ac¬commodation affect functionaries in all bran¬ches of the public service, and that the diffi-culty of aiding the large number of petty employes has not been overstated in the recent official community. But we feel that a section, at all events, of the small or inter-mediate employes—married men with large families and good records for choice—deserved first aid. An officer with a simple bullet wound can give op his place in the ambulance to a private who has had the misfortune to stop some fragments of a shell, without loss of dignity, and we cannot help feeling that some of the victims of iniquitous rents might similarly have waited their turn with¬out very grave inconvenience. Moreover, a scheme that only aids officials who can afford to pay rents of from £150 to £200 a year is bound to Be misinterpreted. The Govern-ment has already been accused of raising up caste distinctions between the various classes of offi¬cials, of unduly favouring the British employes, who are certainly expected to benefit the most from the scheme, and of neglecting the com- | plaints of the poorer functionaries. All these criticisms may be refuted. “Suave mari magno, etc.,” has never been the motto of the 1 present Administration. But it is-a fair ques¬tion whether it was worth incurring them.

                    <p>There was told in Paris last week a moving story of how the Louvre is kept supplied with the mummies of ancient Pharaohs. The embalm¬ed remains of primitive kings have done very well in their own tombs, but the process was never intended to stand the ordeal of light in a glass case in a modern museum. Hence the mummies gradually fall to pieces, and as the supply of genuine Pharaohs fails, it has to be supplemented Cargoes of nameless mummies are shipped to France and are kept in the vaults of the Louvre to be brought out surrep-titiously as wanted to replace that of some historical personage whose bones have frittered away under the action of a northern atmosphere. This kind of substitution is carried out in the early hours of the morning and a correspondent of a Paris journal was on Wednesday week pri- vileged to assist at it.

                <p>Championship Won By Greek Athlete.</p>
                 <p>It may safely be said that the most absorbing topic discussed at the annual meeting of the Alexandria Amateur Athletic Club yesterday on the A.S.C. grounds was- the weather. And many were the aspersions cast on the Clerk of the Weather, who had so ill-favoured the great sporting event of the year in our town. Certainly the climatic conditions were of the most unseasonable charc-ter- cold, raw, and windy, with ominous clouds which obscured the warming sun's rays at intervals and made everyone shiver. After the boisterous weather of the past two days it was feared that we might have rain, but though the rain kept off, providentially, the wind did not abate and it was a moot point whether half a gale or a khamseem was preferable. However, the choice was not given to the committee, who had to do the best they could with half a gale. The wind was conducive to fast times and the times of the different races compared very favourably with those of some years past, albeit the spectators would have preferred it other-wise. There was a large attendance of the public, though not quite as large as we have seen on previous occasions. Many, no doubt, especially the ladies, were deterred from coming by the unfavourable state of the weather, which was not conducive to a due display of now spring frocks,and though, as one spectator remarked, the grandstand was a 'galaxy of color', we have seen it look much brighter than it was yesterday. The ground bore a gray appearance, with flags and banner flying in every direction. Among those present we noticed some officers belonging to the American cruiser Brooklyn and the Austro-Hungarian Squadron.</p>
                    <p>Athletically, the meeting was a great success, the one blot being the poorness of the entry in the quarter-mile race. This must be a count-ed for by the fact that the race is of such a punishing character that men running subse-quently in the half-mile prefer to give it a wide berth. It was with regret that we noted the very poor reponse to the one event open to all comers- the obstacle race. The Clerk of the Course had put his whole back into the arrang-ing of obstacles. The result was most pleasing to the eye and should have afforded unlimited amusement to the spectators. Only four, however, turned out for the race instead of the fifteen or twenty we have generally seen. The tug-of-war, too, was confided entirely to the "Dublins". "A" team winning the final after a pull of about four minutes. The Alexandria police failed to put in an appearance for their match with the fire brigade, who were given a walk-over. In the open 100 and 220 the handicappers gave Aly Fahmy Ahmed a task just a little beyond his ability, fine runner though he is.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the club events, we have with much regret to report an accident to J.R. Lees, last year's champion. He has been doing exceedingly well in practice this year and gave indications of possibly repeating his performance of last year. After getting a second from scratch in the 150 yards, he won the 100 from a 1-yard penalty, but in the winning of it, in fact, just after passing the post, he fell heavily and so injured his collar-bone that he was unable to take further part in the sports. But for this accident we might have seen a keen competition for the championship. E. A. Willmott, from short marks, was successful in the two sprint handicaps and came in a very good second in the 100 yards. He would have made a bid for Lord Cromer's Cup had he entered for more events. The champion of the day was E. Tsaloumas, an exceedingly good all-around athlete. He won all the jumps and the hurdle race and was second in putting the shot. His points numbered 28 and his nearest opponent was Willmott with 19. Tseloumas is a Greek who has youth on his side. He is going to Athens for the Olympic games and we wish him success, although he will come in contact with a different class of opponents in the jumps. He is a useful runner also, but for some reason or other did not enter for the sprints. The result of the sports might be called a Greek invasion, as besides the all-round success of Tseloumas we have to chronicle a magnificent "put" of 37 feet 7 1/2 inches in the shot by Veranakis. This is better than has been done for about twenty years, the nearest to it in that time being 36 feet 6 inches-also by a Greek, Valissarides. We must not omit the mention of Tseloumas' jump of 20 feet 4 inches, which beats by two inches the record for the course. In the half-mile there were ten runners. Peel, last year's winner seemed to crack up early against the wind and J.D. Carver off the 40 yard mark came in a few yards ahead of Blythman (scratch), who was confidently expected to win. Blythman in his turn was a good way in front of Wallace. The journey down to the hurdle almost in the teeth of the wind militated against fast time being done but 2 minutes 12 1/5 seconds was very fair. The Veterans' Race was the best seen for many years, and the large entry is encouraging to the continuance of the event on the programme. Gooding, from a long start, was too speedy for the rather heavily penalized Freeman, a dual winner of this race, and he romped in a fairly easy winner. Burrill, also penalised, was a good third. The Children's Race, a most popular event filled very well and afforded plenty of amusement. Lillian Cheva-ier, a 6 year old, got in a yard in front of Marion Percival, with Lionel Burrill, a chip of the veteran, a few inches behind. The handi-cappers, who have very thankless tasks to undertake, did their work uncommonly well, as the judges and referees can testify, the finishes in the sprint handicaps giving them something to think about.</p>

                    <p>Madame Girard presented the prizes with a few graceful words of congratulation to the winners. Mr. Haselden called for three cheers for the champion, which were very heartily given, his success being especially gratifying to a large number of his compatriots. Mr. Gould proposed three cheers for Mme Girard for her kindness in giving away the prizes, and on the call of M P. W. Carver, the clerk of the course and the hoc. secretary were similarly honoured. By the kindness of Col. Bird, D.S.O., and. the officers of the Dubline, the regimental and the fife and drum bands played selections during the afternoon. The prizes were, as usual, very handsome and well-chosen, reflecting credit on the prize committee. The following are the results of the different competitions

                <div type="item"> <head>A CONSTITUTION FOR EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>SHEM EL-BAKRI AND LORD</p>
                    <p>DUFFERIN.</p>
                   <p> The “open letter,’’ which Sheikh el Bakri has addressed to the Prince of Wales on the subject of a constitution for Egypt, is based in great part on the celebrated Report of Lord Dufferin. Bat the establishment in Egypt of a system of representative government as Lord Dufferin summed up in his 'Synopsis of Proposed Egyptian Institutions” will never be possible in Egypt as it is contrary to the fundamental ideas of the Oriental, for even the most modified form of Parliamentary system baa not, and is never likely to have, the slightest chance of taking root in a country like Egypt. None of the other reforms suggested by Lord Dufferin were so Utopian as this. In nearly all other matters be not only laid his finger at once on the ailing spot, but the remedies he suggested, if frequently incapable of immediate application, were al-ways sound in themselves and have in many instances been subsequently applied.
                    </p><p>Lord Milner’s criticism of the proposals of Lord Dufferin, whereon Sheikh el Bakri bases in great measure his arguments, are much to the point The passage run as follows :— “He was right in not despairing of the ultimate independence of Egypt; he was right in effort. But on the other hand, he certainly glossed over the deep-rooted obstacles which his scheme of reform was bound to encounter, and above all the length of time which would be required to accomplish it. His rose-coloured picture of an Egypt ‘un¬-trammelled’ by external importunity, though aided by sympathetic advice and assistance,’ of the Egyptians governing themselves on civilized principles without an irritating.and exasperating display of authority on our part, though ‘under the uncompromising series of our friendship,’ was exactlv united" to hit the pre¬vailing taste, both in Egypt and Great Britain.
                    </p><p>It flattered the self-importance and the shallow Liberalism of the Pachas, always ready to sym¬pathise with reforms, until they began to come home to them in the shape of harder work, diminished license, and fewer opportunities of self-enrichment. I was no less grateful to the British people in their honest desire to play the part of guide, philosopher, and friend to the people of Egypt, but to play it cheap. And it the same time it concealed from both parties he disagreeable side of the business : from the Egyptians, the long period of irksome control and training through which they would have to pass on their [gap] to a civilised independ-¬ence ; from the English, the corresponding period of close attention to the affairs of Egypt and the effort, anxiety, and risk which such attention involved.”
