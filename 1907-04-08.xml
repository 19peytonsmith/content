                    <head> The State of Egypt</head>
                    <p> "Though we are most anxious not to take up an unnecessarily alarmist
                        attitude in regard to as a Egypt" says the “Spectator”, “we feel obliged to
                        return to the subject treated by us some three weeks ago. Evidence which we
                        cannot doubt convinces us that serious harm is being done to the cause of
                        good government in Egvpt—in other words, to the best interests of the
                        Egyptian people—by the foolish and ill-considered agitation which is being
                        conducted by a certain suction of British Radicals. The fact that those
                        responsible for this agitation are well meaning and do not realize the
                        consequences of their acts, does not in the least mitigate the evil that is
                        being done. Mr. J. M. Robertson and his friends in England imagine that he
                        is championing a popular cause and standing up for the rights of the people.
                        In reality he is in danger of allowing himself to be made the cat's-paw of a
                        combination of selfish and unscrupulous men whoso object is not popular
                        rights or sound administration, but simply and solely to got rid of tho good
                        government established by the British people through the instrumentality of
                        Lord Cromer and his subordinates, and to substitute for it what we a have no
                        hesitation in saying would prove the worst and most immoral form of
                        despotism that the world can show-that is, not the crude despotism of
                        primitive Mohamedanism, but of the Oriental who, while losing his own faith
                        and principles, has gained nothing but evil from his intercourse with the
                        West. </p>
                    <p> No one who knows anything of the facts can doubt that the most ruinous type
                        of ruler, morally and economically, inflicted upon a Turkish province is tho
                        Pasha who, with-a veneer of European civilization, has retained the
                        instincts of primitive savagery. If the sophistries of Mr. Robertson and his
                        friends prevail, and if for enlightened British rule it exists in Egypt
                        today is substituted some ridiculous travesty of Parliamentary government,
                        it is absolutely certain that tho result will not be merely a defective and
                        blundering system of democracy, such as can no doubt be tolerated, and ought
                        to be tolerated, while a people naturally fit for government are learning to
                        use their freedom, but the most degraded form of Oriental despotism. The
                        people of Egypt, we admit, do not appreciate fully the blessings of English
                        rule, and yearn, no doubt, for the happy-go-lucky ways of the former regime.
                        But this discontent with what they regard as the irksome tidiness and method
                        of European administration is not enough to make them fit for true self
                        government. Such self government they would find far more irksome than
                        British rule. In order to avoid it they would, till the revolution point of
                        misery had been reached, tolerate a return even to the squalid horrors of
                        the Ismail regime. And unfortunately for Egypt, it is doubtful whether the
                        revolution point would be reached before the country had been completely
                        ruined for by nature the Egyptians are the most timid and submissive of men.
                        Serious insurrection in Egypt against any power, however oppressive is
                        almost unthinkable. It is true that the revolt of Arabi took place; but that
                        was only because Arabi and his soldiers were unpaid. Had they received their
                        pay, the Egyptian people would never have moved, nor would Arabi have come
                        forward as a patriot. But though the Egyptian is absolutely submissive in
                        the face of tyranny, he is a quick-witted man, and has a positive genius for
                        intrigue. If you can assure him the strong arm of the law will not be
                        invoked to crush conspiracy, and if he also is inspired with the notion,
                        first, that his existing governors are likely to be worried into abounding
                        the task of governing, and secondly, that when this is accomplished the
                        sovereign authority will fall into the hands of another set of men whom he
                        has a natural and traditional dread-that is, the old Pasha or Turkish
                        class-he will be quick to throw himself at the feet of those who he imagines
                        are destined to rule lower him in the future, and who he believes it will be
                        to his interest to conciliate. That is what is beginning to happen now. The
                        Egyptian people, though they love platitude and sophistry for their own
                        sakes, and to a certain extent enjoy the rhetoric of discontent, are
                        probably at heart not very much impressed by the talk about liberty and free
                        government with which their native newspaper are now flooded,-partly under
                        the inspiration of British doctrinaires. They judge from such talk, however,
                        that for some reason or other the British people have got tired of ruling
                        them, and are going to give up the task, and that thereupon sovereignty with
                        all its privileges and powers will return into the hands of Khedive and his
                        entourage. Accordingly there is a tidal wave of frothy anti-British and
                        pro-Khedival sentiment spreading throughout the Nile Valley, and making its
                        impression felt even in the distant Sudan, where the Army and the minor
                        civilian employees of the Government are being made uneasy by the news that
                        there is not be some great though unexplained alteration in the political
                        situation. That they could not describe in detail what the change is to be
                        is quite immaterial. The Oriental's first impulse when he fears change is to
                        take out an insurance policy against that change by currying favour with
                        those whom he thinks are likely in the end to get the upper hand. There is
                        an Egyptian proverb which declares that when one meets "the bear in the day
                        of his wrath the wise man feeds him with honey, while the fool emits him on
                        teahead with a pole." The bear in his what used to stand for the British
                        power, and hence that bear was largely fed with honey. Now, thanks to the
                        notion that Mr. Robertson and his friends control the British Government,
                        and are going to put an end to Lord Cromer's authority, the Khedive and his
                        friends, decked out with some phrases about Parliamentary institutions, are
                        the bear which is to be cajoled and propitiated. </p>
                    <p> We have so often of late had occasion to criticize the action of the present
                        Government that we must take care not to let it be supposed that we are
                        suggesting that either his Majesty's Ministers or the Liberal Party as a
                        whole are responsible for the very grave situation which has arisen in
                        Egypt. We are quite confident that not only Sir Edward Grey, but the Prime
                        Minister and the rest of his colleagues are prefect sound in regard to Egypt
                        and have not the slightest intention of withdrawing their support from Lord
                        Cromer. Unfortunately however, the knowledge of this fact possessed by the
                        British people is not shared by the Egyptians. They have been taught to
                        believe that the present Government is entirely in the hands of men like Mr.
                        Robertson, and that the strange and mysterious body, the House of Commons,
                        has entirely altered its views at to how Egypt is to be ruled. In these
                        circumstances, it is most welcome to find a Liberal Member of Parliament
                        like Sir Christopher Furness making strong protest against the attempts of
                        Mr. Roberson and those who think with him to ruin the splendid work which we
                        have accomplished in Egypt during the last twenty years. </p>

                    <p>Since times change and we with them, the caricature or even a ludicrously
                        faithful pre-sentiment of what is out of date is rather a clue and
                        catchpenny form of pathos. Sochat least was the impression left us by
                        "Brichanteaui" a long play adapted by M de Feraudy himself from M- Jales
                        Claretie’s novel of that name- Brichanteau is an actor of the old llorid and
                        hymbasitic school, relegated first to the provinces and then to oblivion by
                        the more reposeful theatre which is at present in vogue. We have no read the
                        novel but make no doubt that M. Clrette attains his primary object in
                        engagine our sympathy with the vicissitudes of the sueperannuated old actor;
                        he is intended, we are sure, to earn our pity in his obstinate
                        self-confidence dogs him quixotically during the greater part of his
                        existence, rather than to hold up to our ridicule his old-fashioned ranting
                        absurdities. But as a play, M de Feraudy had satirized that of some famous
                        modern actor, his own for instance. In Robertson's David Garrick, '' Sir
                        Charles Wydnham would easily love our sympathy if he had to go through some
                        long delcamatory speech in the style of the period, Mr. Pinero in "Trewlawnt
                        of the Wells," also recognised the danger and keeps his Mr. and Mrs.Telfer
                        well in the background, and what dismal failures the “Crummleses" and "Miss
                        Petowker" would be if we had to take them seriously! Thus it is that when we
                        have once made Brichanteau's acquiantance and perceive the error of his
                        ways, we gradually begin to lose interest in him. His necessarily consistent
                        antiquity begins to pall. </p>
                    <p>Nous avous change tout cela and the laborious process of the change does not
                        as we have said enlist our sympathy. The first act, incomparably the best of
                        the four, is rather on the lines of "A Pantomime Rehersal" and it is hard to
                        say which is the more amusing of the two. Not only "was M. de Feraudy's
                        performance on Friday last as great a mascrpiece as any of his former
                        triumphs, but his make-up and the general atmosphere created wero no small
                        delight. He was very well assisted in this and following act by Mille Hel ne
                        Mais and M. Goornae. Acts II and III, which would be the hotter for some
                        cuts, simply show us various and more or less detached incidents in
                        Brichmiteau's meteoric career: his idea of theatrical honour, theatrical
                        love, licit and illicit, theatrical duelling and so forth which if they do
                        not precisely entrance our enthusiasm for the plot, leave us nevertheless
                        amazed once more at M. de Feraudy's powerful dramatic gifts. In Act II M.
                        Houry's Englishman had a very favourable and deserved reception. The last
                        act does not compare very favourably with "Cyrano de Bergerac” though the
                        resemblance is marked by the hero’s dying in harness with a final confession
                        of love. Here M. de Feraudy, admirable to the last, was well supported by
                        Mile Van Doren. On the whole we were disappointed that Feraudy the
                        playwrite, did not come within measurable distance of Feraudy the actor.</p>
                    <p>After smiliug condescendingly on Brichaneteau's old-fashioned
                        attitundinarising, we had to reverse our train of thought and admit the
                        conquest of the "hohero Tochtcr” and her scientific education by the homely
                        back-to-the- is land marry-and-live happily-ever-after doctrine set forth in
                        M Brieux's "Blanchette." given on Saturday evening. The play, an up-to-date
                        version of the prodigal son, is not one of M. a Brieux's best, but
                        nevertheless his usual searchlight is brought to bear on modern social
                        problems, and he thus fulfils one of the most importain aims of true dramas.
                        The weak point is the finale, which, with guilty haste, descends into the
                        fallacies of Brichanteauism. Apart from this, the adherence to realism is
                        maintained simply and effectively. Onco more M. de Feraudy, as Roussct, drew
                        a life-like portrait. To be uniformally successful night after night in
                        roles whose variety is as striking as their execution is faithful is a proof
                        of talent such as few modern actors can present. We think after this
                        outburst, we need only add, that those few misguided players who have not
                        yet visited the ‘Zizinia" are to be sincerely pitied. </p>
                    <p>As “Blanchette” Mlle Van Doren kept well within the limit of her powers and
                        infused her adruous part with sufficient force and sympathy to worthily
                        second M de Feraudy. Mme Marie Laure as Mme Roussct was again good in her
                        quiet way; but she should display more embarrassment in the last act where
                        she is concealing her daughter's presence from her Mme Rousset is not the
                        stage lady of fashion who can perpetrate all sorts of enomouities without
                        turning a hair.</p>

                    <head>OUTLOK MORE SERIOUS</head>
                    <p>FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT</p>
                    <p>Since Friday there has been no change in the state of affairs as regard the
                        possibilities of a settlement, with the exception that the Canal Company's
                        men have returned to work with an increase of P T.l per day, but as these
                        men were not in any way connected with the discharging and bunkering Arabs
                        on strike, it cannot to be assumed that the latter will be granted their
                        demands. Attempts were made on Friday night to prevent any men going to the
                        harbour to work. The strikers had sent out a number of armed pickets to
                        guard all roads leading from the Arab village to the harbour, bat but with
                        the exception of a little interference, nothing happened of a sensational
                        character. The men who are working such as the Salt Works and Cabal Company
                        labourers are escorted by a squad of police to and from the harbour. Owing
                        to the disturbance which occurred during the coaling of the Orient Mail
                        steamer Ormuz, every effort is being made by port police to prevent the
                        strikers from congregating around the harbour, whilst the town police are
                        also kept busy in the European quarter. The extra draft of police from Cairo
                        together with officers have arrived and are rendering great service to a
                        local force </p>
                    <p>Although there is apparently a dead-lock in the negotiations, the masters
                        again met in counsel at 9.30 this morning. The meeting was not of long
                        duration and althought Press representatives were not admitted, we
                        understand little more was done than to report on the progress of
                        discharging etc. The outlook is becoming more serious every day; cargoes of
                        coal are arriving daily for the port, but, as the discharging has to be done
                        by the ships own crews, the work is very slow, on an average about 200 tons
                        being the daily output, whereas under ordinary circumstances about 800 tons
                        is only considered a fair day's work. Many of these ships have other
                        charters and owing to this strike, the likelihood is that in many cases
                        these charters will have to be cancelled. This will mean a heavy loss to the
                        shipowners; and the delays in bunkering steamers is also serious. Vessels
                        taking 200 tons are frequently here twenty four hours.</p>

                    <p>One of the most interesting questions of the day in, Cairo is what action
                        will M. Grandmoulin take in reference to the disgraceful charges that have
                        been brought against him by the Nationalist Press. The English organ of
                        Mustapha Pasha Kamel, the "Egyptian Standard" used the words "guilty, as he
                        is of assassination" "in regards to the accidental shooting of the native
                        boy by the French official of the Egyptian Government Under such
                        circumstances it is obvious that M Grandmoulin has only one course open to
                        him, namely to submit the question to the law courts. Everybody in this
                        country sympathises with M. Grandmoulin owing to the atrocious charges
                        brought against him and it is to be hoped that he will obtain some solatium.
                        As, however, he is in official in the service of the Egyptian Government his
                        line of action is dependent on his superiors and it is openly declared in
                        native circles that the Nationalist Party is so powerful at the present time
                        that it is believed that no action will be taken in this matter.</p>

                <head>CAIRO’S DRAINAGE</head>
                <head>THE LATENT THEORIES</head>
                <p>The most serious problem awaiting solution in Cairo is the question of the new
                    schemes for settling the difficulties of the drainage once and for all. The
                    enormous growth of the city within the last few years has rendered a speedy
                    solution of this grave problem absolutely inevitable and from every point of
                    view the sanitation of the Capital of Egypt must be considered as among the most
                    serious questions, with which Egypt will have to deal at once. There are at the
                    present time about four projects for the consideration of the Ministry of Public
                    Works. The specialist in this matter on whose decision so much depends, is Mr.
                    Carkett James, the well-known Anglo-Indian drainage expert, who made the
                    drainage of Bombay one of the most admirable in the East. He is strongly in
                    favour of utilising the immediate neighbourhood of Tourah. This site is
                    advantageous because there is an inlet into the Eastern hills, which will
                    provide all the necessary area. At the present time this is only a bare expanse
                    of desert, which is absolutely useless, except for a rifle range, which it is
                    used by the British Rifle Club at Cairo, who could easily find a site for their
                    exploits between that point and the city.</p>
                <p> Another scheme is to make the sewage farm in the neighbourhood of Khanka, beyond
                    Materieh and Marg. There is a large area of desert laud available. The objection
                    to this site appears to lie in the fact that it is to the North East of the City
                    and is farther away in point of distance than Tourah. Any other scheme, such as
                    Rod-el-Farag will not be accepted, as the levels there are low and the water
                    must naturally percolate into the Nile</p>

                        superinterad the erection of the new British Consulate in Cairo, which is to
                        be built in tho RueGamih. El Cherkass near the Savoy Hotel and opposite the
                        Austro-Hungarian Consulate General. The work of excavating and laying the
                        foundations is now being proceeded with by Messrs. Sabatelli, the
                        contractors, and it is expected that the building will be completed and
                        ready for occupation in 10 or 12 months time, probably by next December. The
                        area of the ground is a little 600 square metres and it was purchased in
                        1903 at the rate of P.T. 420 per metre whereas hand in the vicinity is now
                        fetching from LE. 30 to LE 40. The total cost of the premises and site is
                        estimated at about £10,000, for which amount a special grant was made by the
                        British Government. The offices of the Consulate and the Consular Court will
                        be on the ground floor, whilst the two upper storeys will as serve a
                        residence for the Consul.</p>

                        1821, was celebrated by the Greek colonies throughout Egypt yesterday with
                        great enthusiasm. At Alexandria the day began with a special service at, the
                        Evangelismo’s Cathedral, which was conducted by the Patriarch, the Bishop of
                        Tripoli and a large number of notables staff of clergy. The Consul General
                        and a large number of notables attended. A reception followed at the Greek

                        before the Consulate. In the afternoon at 4 o’clock about ten thousand
                        "people assembled at Chatby to assist at the laying of the foundation stone
                        of Mr. Emanuel Benachi’s orphanage. The ceremony took place under the
                        patronage of the Patriarch, who conducted a religious service there. The

                        the Greek Girls School with the Stuff and pupils and a large crowd of
                        people. The stone was blessed by the Patriarch and laid by Benachi, assisted
                        by the chiefs of the Greek gymnasium, Messrs. L. Risopoulos; A. Skenderanis,
                        Alex. Maori. L. Laksrdis, and young Michel Salvago.</p>
                    <p>The stone was christened by a big bottle of champagne. After the ceremony

                    of the Countess de Vanreal, whuch took place yesterday, in, Paris. The Countess
                    was the daughter of Mr. Eugene Debourg, the managing director of the Egyptian
                    Salt and Soda Company Limited. His daughter married a few year's ago the Comte
                    de Vaureal, a member of the old French nobility. She was confined a short time
                    ago and afterwards was attacked by influenza, the malady leading to a fatal
                    issue owing to her weak state of health. The Countess spent her youth in
                    Alexandria and was a very popular figure in society here. Great sympathy is felt
                    for M and Mme Eugene Debourg at their untimely loss. </p>
