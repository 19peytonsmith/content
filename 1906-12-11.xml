                        was amply manifest on Saturday afternoon. The organisation of the brigade is
                        distributed into six stations, Moharrem Bey, Minet-el-Bassal, Menshieh,
                        Ramleh, Ras-el-Tin, and Ibrahimieh, and the total force musters 120 men.
                        Moharrem Bey, where an exhibition of the fire extinguisher's art took place
                        on Saturday, is the headquarters, and an old station, but for all that none
                        the lens energetic. For recently it underwent a series of reforms, in the
                        way of repairing sheds and out-buildings. It is not an imposing erection,
                        and would hut ill compare with Captain Blake's trim building at Cairo ; hut
                        “comparisons are odious. It is the intelligent organisation within which is
                        the outer adornment of Moharrem Bey. Not so many years ago, a goat’s walk
                        skirted the foot of Kom el Dik from the station to Rosetta road, but this
                        has been transformed into a carriageable road along which the brigade’s fire
                        engines can proceed should their services be required in that quarter. The
                        reforms alluded to are under the supervision of an expert who lately came
                        out from England. So that we can look for much in the not distant
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Coming now to the results of Saturday's show, as our reporter justly
                        observed, me-chanical perfection, is all very well, but it is after all the
                        human machine that tells in the end, and the Municipality, the insurance
                        agent, and the timid citizen may well congratulate and comfort themselves on
                        having such stalwarts to protect their lives and property. Happily,
                        Alexandria, excepting a cotton shoonah blare occasionally, is free from
                        disastrous fires ; hence the prosperity of the insurance companies ; and so
                        the services of Captain Waller and his men are not often required. While
                        this is not to be regretted, there is this plea for their existence and high
                        efficiency, and it is a plea based on the broad grounds of—to borrow a
                        Tautonism— Welt politik. In the fire brigades, as in every other service, we
                        have introduced rules of discipline and organisation that did not exist
                        before. Previously tatterdemalion volunteers and other bar- barous
                        sansulottes flew with their hand pumps to the scene of fire,—to steal what
                        they would not extort as the price of their undesirable services. British
                        Occupation, however, changed all this, and order prevails where it did not
                        before. To the native mind, therefore, this high standard of efficiency, in
                        the defensive or civil services, and in our own local case, that of
                        Alexandria's “Askari touroumba,” stands as the symbol and measure of what we
                        are worth.</p>

                            fifteen years of age, to run away from home and go to Tilbury. There she

                        <p>The authorities at Washington have informed the American Diplomatic Agent

                        <p>We regret to bear that Mrs. Arthur Kelham had a nasty fall from her horse
                            yesterday afternoon during the Royal Dublin Fusiliers’ paper chase.
                            While galloping over the desert near Sidi Bichr her horse unexpectedly
                            encountered a line of barbel wire in mid-desert Mr. Kelham was thrown
                            headlong over the horns and the latter was severely cut about the
                            breast. </p>
                        <p>The rise in properly has induced a large number of people to speculate in
                            desert sites in the neighborhood of Alexandria, and one of the
                            unpleasant, consequences of going for a ride in what was a few yeats ago
                            a free an open expanse of sand, is that now in the midst of a gallop one
                            is very likely to be thrown and one’s steed seriously injured by coming
                            into unexpected contact, with these signs of private ownership. The
                            custom of putting up barbed wire is especially dangerous to the police
                            and coast guard mounted patrols who are in the habit of visiting the
                            secluded esbehs by night.</p>

                            might have had most shocking injuries. There were a number of other
                            riders following her and they were only just in the nick of time to pull
                            up when they saw the lady’s mishap.</p>

                        <p>RUMOURED SALE OF PROPERTY.</p>
                        <p>We hear that the Tewfik Palace Hotel at Helouan has been sold by Dr.
                            Bentley, the owner, to a group resembling a powerful local syndicate.
                            Since the present proprietor acquired the property some seven years ago
                            it has been greatly improved, both as regards buildings and ground",
                            which improvements have vastly increased its value. The Tewfik Palace
                            was formerly the favourite residence of the late Khedive Tewfik, and it
                            is there that his Highness died.</p>
                        <p>The situation of the hotel is one of the finest in Helonan, being
                            isolated from all buildings and on the edge of the desert. The
                            race-course adjoins the property, and Dr. Bentley, who is himself a keen
                            sportsman, spent a large sum in making the course and erecting a stand,
                            and the purchasers of the property are to be congratulated on having
                            acquired what will no doubt prove a valuable investment.</p>
                        <p>It is reported that the hotel will be transferred to its new owners at

                            of the National Bank into a State Bank, as far as is compatible with the
                            cordi-tions of the country. The proposals of the Government were

                        <p>THE PLAYS OF MENANDER.</p>
                        <p>A highly interesting discovery has just been made in this country. M.
                            Lefebvre, one of the inspectors in the service of the Department of
                            Antiquities, has been fortunate enough to disinter a large number of
                            leaves of a papyrus codex of Menander, containing upwards of 1,200
                            lines. The leaves are not continuous, but be has found as much as 500
                            lines from each of two plays, two more being represented by smaller
                            quantities The publication of this most welcome discovery is promised
                            for next year, and should enable modern scholars for the first time to
                            form an independent judgment on the style and genins of the famous comic
                            dramatist.</p>
                        <p>Menander was the most popular dramatist of the Graeco Roman world, and
                            his comedies of manners were the models that Plautus and Terence freely
                            copied, and through them influenced the modern drama in its early days.
                            Yet the works of this much praised Greek have hitherto been known to
                            modern scholars only in short fragments, and his fame has had to be
                            taken on trust. The new discovery, it seems, includes long portions of
                            two plays, making about five hundred lines of each. It should now be
                            possible, therefore, to form an accurate opinion of the literary merits
                            of the "New Comedy,” almost as well as the older Aristo-phanic comedy,
                            of which, by some curious trick of fate, so many examples have been
                            preserved. This happy find is a new illustration of the value of
                            spade-work io archaeology. The sands of Egypt, and perhaps also the
                            buried libraries of Heronlaneam, doubtless hold many more literary

                        <p>The figures of exports of Egyptian cotton from the commencement of the
                            season to November 28 show that the shipments from Alexandria for Great
                            Britain’s use have been 146,472 bales, which is 24,301 more than last
                            year’s at this time Out of these Liverpool re-ceives83.750 bales and
                            Manchester 62,722 bales, which, compared with last year at this time,
                            shows an increase of 9,847 bales to Liverpool and 14,454 bales to
                            Manchester. The shipments to the United States are 13,414, against
                            19,752 bales, and to the Continent, India, and Japan altogether 90,785

                            250,571 bales, which compares with 225,243 bales at the corresponding
                            time last season.</p>
                        <p>Commenting upon the growth of the port of Manchester, at the annual

                            during the year ended August 31 constituted a record, having amounted to
                            212,257 bales against 183,297 in the previous season. That this is some
                            44 per cent. of the total imports of Egyptian cotton to Great Britain
                            should, he said, be a matter of considerable satisfaction to all. The
                            balance of the importations amounted to 3,383 bales, and were composed
                            of East Indian and African cotton. Since the Ship Canal was opened up to
                            the end of last season there have been lauded at the port of Manchester
                            nearly five and a-half million bales of cotton.</p>
                        <p>So far as the present season was concerned, actual arrivals and ”at sea”
                            of American cotton up to date amounted to 133,665 bales, against 102,921
                            bales in the previous season, and for Egyptian the figures were 61.245
                            bales, against 51,921 bales. Moreover, he was told that the bookings for
                            Manchester in America were very much ahead of last year. In consequence
                            the shipowners had increased their tonnage, and intended to do all they
                            could to keep a plentiful supply, so that there should be no lack of
                            freight room. It remained for the spinners to do their part and give all
                            the support they could to the direct importation of cotton to
                            Manchester.</p>

                        <p>In the House of Commons, a few days ago, Mr. Dillon asked the Secretary
                            of State for Foreign Affairs whether the Ministry of Finance in Egypt
                            had opened a special credit, of L.E. 12.000 to meet the expenses of the
                            Special Court and the pay of the employes who were engaged in the
                            Denishwai case ; and if so whether a detailed and audited account of the
                            expenditure of this sum would be communicated to the House.</p>
                        <p>Sir Edward Grey :—I have no information on the subject. The matter is one
                            which solely concerns the Government of Egypt.</p>

                            convicts of Denishwai, and that a partial satisfaction to these
                            petitions is imminent.</p>

                        <p>L’ESPIONNE.”</p>
                        <p>We were prevented from seeing ”Le Passe" on Sunday, but we hear it was
                            far better than “Francillon,” and most certainly last night’s
                            performance of Sardou’s "Espiome” marked a still greater improvement. It
                            would be unreasonable to say this performance surprised us; it could
                            hardly do more than come up to the high expectations we had formed of
                            Mile Barthes; there can be no doubt that she thoroughly proved herself
                            the artiste that fame has heralded. Her charm lies mainly in her
                            splendid diction, which is the more striking when contrasted with the
                            apology for French that one hears over here. Her voice, though leaving
                            something to be desired on the score of diversity, is wonderfully deep
                            toned and so direct and sincere as to be quietly convincing without need
                            of any recourse to rant. "L’Es-pionne” has no particular "star” part;
                            the action is throughout maintained and well dispersed, which at once
                            enhances the value of the piece per se and enables us to take stock of
                            the accomplished players Mile Barthes has brought with her. The love
                            element of the play gives way a little before the intricacies of
                            diplomacy. This evidently cannot be depicted on the stage without one
                            falling in for stolen keys, secreted documents, and compromising
                            letters. The period dealt with is about 1849, and Andre de Maurillac is
                            on a mission - to Rome with important state papers. On his journey he
                            falls in with and marries Dora, who, no lets than her quaint Spanish
                            mother, is regarded as a somewhat shady char-, acter. On the day of
                            their wedding the "Com-tssse” Zicka, an adventuress in Austrian pay,
                            being frustrated in her love for Maurillao, manages to steal the most
                            important of his papers in such a way that the blame falls on Dora.
                            This, together with a further false accusation of her being the cause of
                            the arrest of Tekli, a Hungarian patriot, is the backbone of the play
                            and elicited opportunity for some admirable scenes i between Mile
                            Barthes, as Dora, and M. Rous-selle, as Maurillac. At length his friend
                            Favrol les (M. Alerme) very cleverly wrests Zicka’s secret from her, and
                            all ends happily for Mau-rillac and his wife. There is a good "swing'
                            and eclat about the whole play : no lame duck or stumbling-blocks. If
                            there was intense attrac tion in Mile Barthes, there was ample counter
                            attraction io Mile Marie Marcilly’s graceful and refined interpretation
                            of Zicka, no less than in the finished performances of MM. Rouselle and
                            Aderme; we cannot, besides, omit mention of Mme Marie-Laur’s Marquise
                            though the accent was a little too perfectly imperfect, and of M. Andre
                            Hall’s Tekli. In fact, such a good ensemble in a touring com-pany
                            reflects great credit on Mile Barthes management and selection.</p>

                        <p>The Galenzi troupe are a great joy. They have brought with them a touch
                            of the "Capucines,” the lightness and elan of its comedies. I saw four
                            short vaudeville fantasias, one more delightful than the other. True,
                            one wouldn’t take everyone to see ‘ le coup de Salomon,” but it was
                            irresistible. M. Martel and M. Henry were faultless, and Mile Demougey
                            had more than a touch of Jeanne Granier in her voice, laugh, and manner.
                            M. Barbier and Mme Gerard were perhaps the best among a most excellent
                            assembly It was good to see something so "piquant” and purely natural, a

                        <p>House of Commons.—Mr. Birrell stated that the Government had decided to
                            ask the House to return the Lords’ amendments to the Education Bill as a
                            whole because they were destructive to the main principles of the
                            measure. He hoped the Lords would then substitute others with a more
                            limited scope. The Government was prepared to consider some concessions,
                            but anything like the present amendments were quite unacceptable. If the
                            Lords persisted in the matter the Bill would be sacrificed. </p>
                        <p>Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman will move a resolution to-morrow to this
                            effect. It is believed that this course is without precedent. A portion

                        <p>In view of the separation law coming into force to-morrow, and the Pope’s
                            prohibition of the religious associations provided for by it, the
                            Government has recently decided to facilitate religious services under
                            the law relative to ordinary public meetings, which considerably
                            modifies its requirements in favour of churches. The Pope having now
                            prohibited compliance with these, M. Briand, up to the present most
                            conciliatory, declares that the incitement to violate ordinary law has
                            entirely changed the situation. The Government will act with energy
                            equal to its previous conciliation, and he has directed all breaches of
                            the law to be prosecuted.</p>

                            <p>The oases are The only exceptions to the uniform desolation, hundreds
                                of thousands of square miles in extent, known as the Libyan Desert.
                                The popular conception of these interesting anomalies of the Sahara
                                is that of a fertile spot, lying amidst miles of sandy wilderness,
                                something after the style of a pleasant, pal u-clad Islet rising
                                above the expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Instead of being merely </p>
                            <p>Verdant bales that blossom midst the Libyan wild</p>
                            <p>they are deep hollows consisting of a number of verdant patches
                                sprinkled at intervals over a carpet of desert, which only differs
                                from the surrounding waste on the plateau in its low-lying
                                character.</p>
                            <p>The oases were begotten ages and ages ago when portions, of the
                                limestone rock of what is now the dreary expanse of the desert were
                                upheaved. The upper limestones were cracked by the violence of the
                                upheaval and afterwards denuded, thus forming slight hollows. Ages
                                passed, and the hollows became a lake, the water carrying on the
                                work of excavation. When the moist climate of Egypt became dry, a
                                change, which may have been connected with the revolution in the
                                climatic conditions of Europe from a glacial to a temperate state,
                                the excavation still went on by means of wind and sand. Century
                                after century these great depressions became slowly larger owing to
                                the eroding force of the sand-laden blasts, and thus the oases were
                                sculptured into the present forms. But nature never stays her hand,
                                and day by day and year by year these hollows are still growing
                                greater owing to the erosion of the sandy wind, their boundaries
                                ever encroaching on the desert plateau, whose scarps are being
                                ground gradually away. These hollows are often of great extent. The
                                oasis of Khargeh, for example, is as large as a good-sized English
                                county, being a depression three thousand square kilometres in
                                extent, a great part being desert. Bah arieh, the smallest of all
                                the oases, is not less than eighteen hundred square kilometres in
                                size, while Farafra and its pendent, the Iddaila oasis, which is
                                only ten kilometres distant, are each larger than Khargeh. Immense
                                areas in Farafra are quite unexplored, while Iddaila has never been
                                explored at all, except for a small portion at the north end.
                                Utterly isolated from the valley of the Nile they have remained
                                aloof from the main stream of Egyptian history, and Khargeh, alone
                                of the oases, has a slight connection with two famous events, the
                                Persian conquest and the Nestorian heresy. Khargeh town was the last
                                civilised place which the host of Cambyses passed through on its way
                                from Thebes to Siwa and the remains of the 50,000 Persian warriors,
                                who were ever seen again by mortal eyes, lie somewhere in the
                                surrounding desert, their skeletons with their panoply preserved in
                                the dry air, a treasure trove for some future explorer of the
                                Sahara. In the Christian era the Great Oasis was the place of
                                banishment for Nestorians the Heresiarch and' one of the most unique
                                remains of antiquity in Egypt is the great city of the dead, the
                                Necropolis of the Nestorians, who followed their Bishop, the victim
                                of Cyril’s hatred, in his exile. Everywhere there are signs that the
                                oases were the flourishing centres of a large population in ancient
                                times. Of late they have become more and more depopulated, for as
                                Egypt’s prosperity increased, large numbers of the younger men
                                sought work in the Nile Valley. As the people dwindled land went out
                                of cultivation and the wells became sanded up The ruins of Egyptian
                                temples, Coptic chapels and monasteries, Roman castles and aqueducts
                                and sites of ancient wells attest how populous the country once ,
                                was. In Khargeh, before the coming of the Corporation of Western
                                Egypt, practically all the wells used for irrigation and over a
                                hundred that had fallen into desuetude owed their origin to the
                                ancient inhabitants.</p>
                            <p>Baharioh is more prosperous than Khargeh, and has a considerable
                                export trade in fruit, yet the area of land cultivated for cereals
                                is said to be slowly diminishing year by year. Twenty years ago 900
                                feddans were cultivated but now there are only 600, the decrease
                                being due to the diminished yield from the springs owing to the
                                inhabitants not taking sufficient measured to keep the wells free.
                                The villages are uninteresting collections of mud hovels inhabited
                                by an entirely Moslem population, there being no native Coptic or
                                Jewish elements. Originally the inhabitants of the oases were Libyan
                                (Berber) tribes, but after annexation to Egypt there was a
                                considerable immigration from Nubia and the Nile Valley. At the

                                doubtful whether they have ever harboured less inhabitants or been
                                more ackward, as regards the resources of civilisation, than they
                                have been during modern times. In 1897 the total population of these
                                oases was as follows : Dakhleh, 17,090 : Khargeh, 7,866 ; Baharieh,
                                6,081 ; and Farafra, 542. They are quiet and well disposed, being
                                unspoilt by contact with low-class Europeans. Before the nineteenth
                                century only two Europeans are known to have visited the oasis of
                                Khargeh, while the others were not entered until the last century,
                                In fact ever since the Arab conquest they appear to have been
                                singularly neglected; and Khargeh town, though of great antiquity,
                                contains not a vestige of Arabic architecture. It is totally unlike
                                any town or village in Egypt proper. The streets are simply low
                                narrow tunnels under the -houses and their darkness and intricacy
                                are suggestive of a rabbit warren. Close to this miserable capital
                                of the Great Oasis, as if to remind the visitor of the former
                                prosperity of the land in comparison with its existing degradation,
                                rises the magnificent temple of Hibis which Darius I. built in
                                honour of Amen-Ra. The Persian King thought that by showing respect
                                to the Egyptian god and by public works of great utility to the
                                country, he would conciliate the people and make them grateful to
                                tho Persian Occupation. But like other alien occupants of Egypt the
                                Persians were detested, and every vestige of their century of
                                occupation has been destroyed throughout the length and breadth of
                                the land, and except in this remote oasis no remains exist of any
                                public buildings of the Persian dynasty. The ruins of temples
                                erected in the times of the Ptolemies and of the Antonines in
                                Khargeh and of others in Baharieh built during the reigns of Apries
                                and Amasis show that the prosperity of the oases continued for many
                                centuries. Olympio-dorus, in the fourth century of our era,
                                described the Egyptian oases as specially celebrated for their
                                fruitfulness and healthiness. “The trees,” he declares, “are
                                constantly loaded with fruit, the corn grown in the oases being more
                                excellent than any other corn, and whiter than snow. Barley is
                                sometimes grown twice, and millet almost always three times a a
                                year. Wells sunk to &amp; depth of 200, 300, or even 500 cubits pour
                                streams of water from their mouths, which is the cause of the great
                                fertility of the land, though the sky is always cloudless.”</p>
                            <p>Like many other valuable assets of the once mighty land of Egypt, the
                                Oases have suffered from the neglect of centuries—their glories have
                                been dimmed, the wells neglected, the Fund allowed to go out of
                                cultivation, and the sand to engulf what were once smiling farms and
                                gardens. Modern enterprise is already at work (repairing the damage
                                done by the dark years of neglect and adversity, new methods are.
                                being employed, and ere long the oases of Western Egypt will see the
                                dawn of a prosperity greater than in the days of the ancient
                                Egyptians or of the Roman Occupation. As the heirs of the ages, we
                                shall reap where others have sown, and the harvest will be more
                                abundant than the ancient ever dared to hope for.</p>
                            <p>It is these oases which form the sphere of operations of the
                                Corporation of Western Egypt, and the most important land concession
                                ever granted in modern Egypt was made in 1903, when that company
                                obtained the right during thirty years of taking up land there with
                                the object of irrigating and selling it to a total extent of 600,000
                                feddans, or about 970 square miles. Three years and a half have
                                elapsed since then—although the term of the concession has not yet
                                begun to run - but owing to the inaccessible character of the
                                country, which the Corporation is developing, no independent account
                                of the progress of the work has up to now been possible. The
                                description of the scope and present position of the undertaking,
                                which is to be published in a series of articles of which this is
                                the preface, should be of interest, for there appears to be a
                                considerable amount of ignorance and misunderstand ing existing in
                                Egypt as to the oases and the practicability of their successful
                                development. The object of these articles is to set before our
                                readers the story of the beginnings of a most important scheme,
                                which can only be brought to a successful issue by means of careful
                                management and costly development. We may add that from all that we
                                have seen of the work now being carried on in the Great Oasis, the
                                Corporation of Western Egypt appears to be honestly trying to carry
                                through a vast undertaking which should be of the utmost benefit to
                                the country at large, for its goal is nothing less than the
                                restoration to Egypt of what was one of her most fertile provinces,
                                which has been utterly neglected and ignored ever since the fall of
                                the ancient world.</p>

                                <p>OPENING OF SPORTING CLUB GROUND</p>
                                <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                                <p>V Port Said, Satarday.</p>
                                <p>This afternoon, H. E. the Governor opened the International
                                    Sporting Club’s ground. There was a large and fashionable
                                    attendance among whom were the Sub Governor and the various
                                    Consuls. Tue town band was in attendance, and tea was provided
                                    for the fair sex. The most interesting and amazing item on the
                                    programme was the Rugby football match between the Club’s team
                                    and a team from H. M. S. Veuns.</p>
                                <p>From a spectacular point of view the game was perhaps
                                    disappointing, as it was almost exclusively confined to the
                                    forwards, who were pitiable sights when half time was called The
                                    Governor kicked off at 3.30p.m. sharp before some 200
                                    spectators, and play settled down in midfield. The Venus
                                    gradually worked down to oar line, and looked like souring, but
                                    the pressure was relieved by a good kick by Wallis. Several
                                    scrums ensued, the ship gradually working up the field again
                                    Gibbs made a splendid effort to cross the line, but was hurled
                                    into touch right in the corner. After several scrums the ball
                                    was touched down by Broatch. Play was on our line when the
                                    whistle sounded half-time, with no score.</p>
                                <p>The second half proved a little more in-teresting. Field made the
                                    first opening for Port Said by intercepting a pass. He looked a
                                    scorer all, over at the start and managed to get well into the
                                    ship’s 25 before he was palled down. A few minutes later Gibbs
                                    got possession and made a good opening, but his pass to bis wing
                                    was a little wild. The next ten minutes were very exciting, the
                                    Venus making several attempts to score, chiefly through Gibbs,
                                    who had exceeding hard line-in not scoring more than once. Just
                                    before time was called two of the ship’s forwards crossed the
                                    line together and scored in the corner, but the try was
                                    disallowed, both players being off-side. After a few minutes’
                                    scrambling time was called.</p>
                                <p>Such a game does not call for much oom-ment. Matters were fairly
                                    level forward although the heeling of our forwards was very
                                    poor. The best man on the field was Gibbs, the ship’s centre
                                    three-quarter. The half-backs played a good game, but were too
                                    inclined to resort to off side tactic , while their passes at
                                    times were rather wild. Field, for Port Said, made some good
                                    openings, but bis passes were always badly taken. Broatch at
                                    full back was a tower of strength, and if was chiefly dae to
                                    this player’s grand defence that there was no score.</p>

                                <p>This match was played on the Institute ground at Gheziret Badrane
                                    on the 7th inst. Some time before the match commenced quite a
                                    respectable crowd had tamed up and when the game started the
                                    fine large verandah was fall of spectators. The homesters lost
                                    the toss and played with the sun in their faces. They attacked
                                    early but the visitors soon transferred play to the other end,
                                    where the Institute defence did very well to keep out a series
                                    of hot attacks. The Institute forwards then made a good attempt
                                    to score and the left wing had some very good tries. Both teams
                                    struggled hard to obtain the lead, but half time arrived with no
                                    score. On the restart the soldiers made some grand attempts to
                                    score and more than once the home defence were very hard
                                    pressed-once Railway men, however, soon found their feet and a
                                    ran up by the forwards ended in a corner being forced. A goal
                                    resulted from the kick. The visitors then made tremendous
                                    efforts to equalize, which they did from a penalty kick given
                                    against an Institute back hr handling. Both teams made strenuous
                                    Attempts to obtain the deciding goal but the final whistle blew
                                    with the score 1 — 1. The tame was an exhibition of hard and
                                    interesting football and was contested in the most gentle manly
                                    and sportsmanlike spirit.</p>

                                    combination was considerably superior to that of their opponents
                                    and the home defence was only once seriously tested. The goals
                                    were scored by A.E. Aubrey and V.R Mustard. The school outside
                                    left (M. Abort el Ezz) played a particularly good game, several

                    <p>This Company has been formed for the pur poses set out in its Memorandum of
                        Associa tion, and especially to carry out business in Egypt and the Soudan.
                        The attention of the Board will, as opportunities present themselves, be
                        more particularly directed to :—</p>
                    <p>1. The purchase, development and subsequent leaning or re sale of
                        agricultural and building land.</p>
                    <p>2. The lending of money, on mortgage or otherwise on land or other approved
                        securities.</p>
                    <p>3. The carrying on of the business of an Investment Company.</p>
                    <p>The removal of all possibility of friction, due to the Anglo French
                        Agreement, end the confidence engendered by the certainty of a pro-tracted
                        British administration, has added the element of stability to Egypt which it
                        previously lacked.</p>
                    <p>That this vital fact is being realised is clearly shown by the remarkable
                        progress row being made in agriculture and commerce, which again is
                        reflected in the ever-increasing prosperity of the natives and the steady
                        ripe in value of all property. While the rise in land values during the last
                        few years has been remarkable, those who are best acquainted with the
                        conditions of the country and its people are emphatically of the opinion
                        that a further steady increase of prosperity and a corresponding improvement
                        in values is assured.</p>
                    <p>The increasing wealth of the natives, whose one form of investment is
                        agricultural land, coupled with the fact of their rapid numerical increase
                        and the natural limit imposed upon the cultivation of new land by the amount
                        of water available for irrigation, all tend to increase the capital and
                        rental values of such land as is either actually under cultivation or is
                        approaching that stage; in addition to which, there always remains the fact
                        that, even if the utmost. possibilities foreshadowed by Sir William Garstin
                        as to water supply were fulfilled, it is estimated by Mr. Lang Anderson that
                        at most about another one and a hall million acres could be brought into
                        agricultural use in the whole of Egypt, and that, only alter an expenditure
                        of over ten millions sterling, during a period of twenty years. At the end
                        of 1904. roughly five and a quarter million acres of land were he'd by about
                        one million owners, of whom nearly seven-eighth were native holders of less
                        than five acres each. With an estimated prevent population of about eleven
                        millions, which is steadily increasing at the rate of about 3 per</p>
                    <p>cent. per annum, and with a revenue and a foreign trade which have increased
                        over 60 and 100 per cent, respectively during the last 25 years, it would
                        appear that the expression used in Lord Cromer’s Report of March last that
                        "the material prosperity of the country rests on a basis of somewhat
                        exceptional solidity” is amply justified</p>
                    <p>In view of the facts above seated this Com-pany will mainly devote itself to
                        the develop ment of selected agricultural estates with a view to their
                        rental or sale to natives in plots suitable to their requirements. Excellent
                        Opportunities frequently occur of lending money on first mortgage at good
                        rates and with an ample margin. With a local Advisory Board composed of
                        business men of high standing and long experience in Egypt good profits may
                        reasonably be expected from this and other forms of investment which require
                        special local knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Mr. John Hicks Paull, the well-known Agri cultural Expert in Egypt, has
                        jumped the Advisory Board, and will act as the Company’s technical adviser
                        for a period of three years.</p>
                    <p>The Company has acquired from The H. end J. Syndicate, Limited, the right to
                        purchase the Kom-EI-Akhdar estate of 4,793 feddans (say 5,000 English
                        acres), situated about 50 miles south of Alexandria, and connected by a
                        tramway, 1 1/2 miles in length, with The Delta Light Railways system. Mr. R.
                        Lang Anderson has reported to The H. and J.. Syndicate, Limited, upon the
                        property, and a copy of his Report is sent herewith.</p>
                    <p>It will be noted that he states that the supply of water appears to be
                        excellent and the property well supplied with main canals. That the soil
                        varies from a very light sandy loam to a heavy black loam, but is all
                        suitable for cultivation of the usual crops of Lower Egypt That the
                        principal buildings are in excellent condition, and quite sufficient for the
                        property. at present, but-more accommodation for tenants will have to be
                        built yearly as the land comes to the letting stare. That the number of
                        working bullocks is sufficient for reclamation purposes, and there is a good
                        supply of mules, horses and donkeys for transport work. The usual crops of
                        cotton, herseem, wheat and barley were doing well. That the property was
                        capable of great development at moderate cost. and if £30,000 were
                        judiciously spent on it during the next five years it could be brought to a
                        capital value of £75 to £80 per feddan That the work of development is
                        simple and follows well known lines, so that the element of unforeseen
                        contingencies was largely diminished. while the results of develop ment were
                        sure. That be advises the property is a good investment at £15 per feddan,
                        and confidently recommends the purchase. That if money on development is
                        well spent, the capital value will increase enormously yearly That the
                        present rental received is L.E. 3,841,600 (=£3,949 sterling), that is £4 per
                        feddan in respect of 980 feddans let, and he states that in his opinion,
                        when fully re-claimed, the whole of the property should let at an even
                        better rent—4 793 feddans at. say, £1.10. per feddan, would give an income
                        of £21.500 per annum.</p>
                    <p>The H. and J. Syndicate, Limited, have obtained an option on a valuable
                        property, of about 55,000 metres, at Rhoda Island, Cairo, which can be
                        secured by this Company at a satisfactory price.</p>
                    <p>The Directors have other business in view which is believed to be of a most
                        profitable venture ; as. however, negotiations are still in progress, it is
                        not possible to give details at present.</p>

                    <p>15, Rue de la Gare de Ramleh, Alexandrie,</p>
                    <p>Egypt, 24th May 1906.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
                    <p>KOM-EL-AHDAR PROPERTY.</p>
                    <p>Having visited the Kom-el Ahdar property,</p>
                    <p>I beg to report as follows : —</p>
                    <p>Situation - The property is well situated and easily got at, being About 50
                        miles south past of Alexandria and only 1 1/2 miles distant from
                        Kom-eI-Abdar Station on the Delta Light Railway, from which point there is a
                        60 centimetre tramway to the principal homestead.</p>
                    <p>Irrigation —The supply of water appeared to be excellent, ard the property is
                        wall supplied with main canals.</p>
                    <p>Drainage on the greater part of the Estate is good, but the drains are too
                        few in number and not deep enough. The whole property would greatly benefit,
                        in my opinion, by a closer and deeper system of canalisation. About 1,000
                        feddans, more or less, are comparatively low lying, and may require to have
                        their drainage pumped during part of the year to reclaim them properly.</p>
                    <p>Soil varies from a very light sandy loam to a heavy black loam, but is all
                        suitable for cul tivation of the usual crops of Lower Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Buildings.—The principal buildings, which Are in excellent condition, are
                        quite sufficient for the property, but more accommodation for tenants will
                        have to be built yearly as the land comes to the letting stage.</p>
                    <p>Stock —The number of working bollocks is sufficient for reclamation purposes,
                        ard there is a good supply of mules, horses, and donkeys for the transport
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Present Condition The usual crops of cotton berseem, wheat, and barley are
                        doing well, and on the high light, soil all round the principal dwelling
                        house. orange and lemon trees would grow well. On several parts of the
                        Estate the cotton was looking very well, but on other parts it was doing
                        badly, simply due, in my opinion, to haring been planted on land not yet
                        sufficiently reclaimed to grow the crop. Rice was being grown as a
                        reclamation crop, and would do batter it the drains were closer and deeper
                        and the land more carefully levelled before the crop was sown.</p>
                    <p>Future Development. The property is capable of great development at moderate
                        cost. If £30,000 judiciously spent on it during the next three years, it can
                        be brought to a capital value of £75 to £80 per feddan. The work of
                        development is simple and follows well known lines so that the element of
                        unforeseen contingencies is largely diminished, while the results of
                        development are sure.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion.—The property is a good investment At £4' a feddan. The revenue
                        for the first year or two will be small, but if the money on development is
                        well spent, the capital value will be increasing enormously yearly, and
                        later on the revenue will come in and go or- increasing until at least £400,
                        is reached. I can confidently recomend the purchase of this estate of 4.793
                        feddans, which, according to Mr Surgack’s figures, has at present a
                        rental</p>
                    <p>of L.E. 3,841 600, from an area of 980 feddan let, which is slightly over £4
                        sterling per feddan ’ and I see no reason why the whole of the properly,when
                        fully reclaimed should not do even better, as some of the let land is not,
                        in my opinion, quite ready to give to tenants, and if the proprietor had
                        kept is in his own bands for another year under reclamation crops he could
                        have got a higher rent.</p>

                        different classes, are taken from Mr. Sursock’s figures. The Half Canal
                        Francaouia is a very valuable asset, but not Being lettable I have pot no
                        value against it. The land tax payable to Government varies from P.T. 5 to
                        P.T 57 per feddan, and. according to Mr. Sursock’s figures, amounts at
                        present to LE. 653 646 mill, which is not heavy, as land tax runs, being
                        only an average of P.T. 13 3/5 per feddan but this, of course,will be
                        increased as the land is reclaimed.</p>
