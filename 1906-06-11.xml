                      <head>INTERNATIONALISM IN SPORT IN EGYPT</head>
                        <p>MONDAY, JUNE 11, 1906</p>
                        <p> At the ceremony in connection with the laying of the foundation-stone of
                            the Victoria College Lord Cromer showed his desire to create a feeling
                            of general goodwill among the different nationalities whom fate has
                            drawn together in Egypt. After twenty years and more of his influence we
                            have seen the country emerge from a state of governmental chaos to a
                            position in the world second to none in general prosperity. In spite of
                            this there has been little tendency in times past for the Europeans to
                            sink their petty party jealousies and to lay aside old differences and
                            unite either socially or in any other way. Perhaps the English residents
                            are to some extent responsible for this. Although not wishing to
                            generalize like Mr. G. K. Chesterton, who in a recent issue of the
                            “Illustrated London News” stigmatises the whole English people as snobs
                            and respecters of persons, those of us who have lived long in Egypt
                            cannot but admit that the English have been inclined to stand aloof from
                            their fellows. There has been no honest attempt in Egypt to adopt the
                            feeling in England and France which finds expression in the "entente
                            cordiale.” Although each nationality will probably alway retain its own
                            characteristics it might be possible to break down in some measure the
                            old ingrained idea that the English, so to speak, stand and always wish
                            to stand alone.</p>
                        <p>In sport, in which the English have certainly taken the lead, there has
                            been a tendency of late for other nationalities to take more than a
                            passing interest. The impetus given to international sports by the
                            success, of the Olympic Games at Athens, largely through the efforts of
                            the King of Greece, backed up by oar own King Edward VII., has not
                            passed unnoticed in Egypt Also the natives have taken to some of oar
                            games, and have already acquired some proficiency in one form of sport
                            at least,—football. The present Governor of Alexandria, Ibady Pacha, did
                            much whilst at Port Said to encourage this game among the natives. Many
                            a hard-fought game the pupils of the Arab School put up against the
                            English, Maltese, and other teams there. It was soon noticed that for
                            individual play many of the natives were man for man the equals and
                            often the superiors of their opponents. In spite of the prophecies of
                            pessimists against the advisability of attempting to put a team composed
                            of different nationalities in the held, such an experiment was made. On
                            that occasion Ibady Pacha himself kicked off, a fact which gave great
                            pleasure to both natives and Europeans as showing his interest in the
                            recreation of the residents. Against the best team H.M.S. Diana could
                            put on the held, the united team, consisting of four natives, five
                            Englishmen, and two Maltese, played a draw. After that occasionally each
                            team would draw on flyers from other teams in special encounters.</p>
                        <p>It was noticed also that towards the end of the season the natives
                            benefited much in their play from learning the art of combination. So
                            proficient did some of the players become that if the game is taken up
                            with the same enthusiasm in future years as the young natives now show,
                            one may some day sees team of “All Arabs” fit to meet a first class
                            English team, and we may yet witness something like a repetition of the
                            triumphs of the original team of Maories, who visited England in the
                            'eighties.</p>
                        <p>It has been said that international cricket and football does more to
                            draw the-colonies and the mother-country together than any Colonial
                            Conference has done or ever can do. On the turf and under it all are
                            equal, and it may be that the encouragement of international games in
                            Egypt will do much to make the different nationalities appreciate the
                            fact that in the sight of God all come into the world equally helpless
                            and all leave the world in thy same condition. In sport at least there
                            should be no artificial barriers of nationality and caste, in other
                            walks of life there must always be distinctions, but in manly sports
                            there is a common ground on which all can start off the same mark. The
                            public- spirited enthusiast who would give a cup or other trophy for
                            competition at football among native teams would not only be a

                        <p>A resident of Cottingham, in Yorkshire, recently caught a large Egyptian
                            lizard in his garden. "It is presumed that the animal was brought over
                            in a steamer to Hull, and escaped,” we are informed. Here, at any rate,
                            there seems to be no doubt on the question of domicile. But how did the
                            lizard of old Nile get across to Cottingham? If it landed in Hull, it
                            had still some five miles In a N.W. direction to go in order to quarter
                            itself in Cottingham. Students of the mysticism of the Orient might
                            conjecture that this Egyptian lizard was really the Cottingham
                            gentleman’s Ks, which had looked in for a visit. As to that we venture

                            hesitate to pay, expecting a speedy fulfilment of the notable’s promise.
                            His expectations have been dashed by the fact that ’his son is now in

                            and were divided into field sports and gymnastic exercises. The whole
                            was under the direction of Mr. H. C. Tookey, who looked every inch an
                            athlete. He certainly has infused in to the college the essence of
                            discipline, which is the aim of all athletics, and the rounds of
                            applause which were showered upon his pupil were no less meant for him.
                            But the person who, above all, deserves the fullest need of praise is

                        <head>AHMED DJELALEDDIN PACHA.</head>
                        <p>One of our contemporaries publishes a letter in its last issue
                            stating, in a tone of great assurance, that the Ottoman Government
                            is highly displeased with the conduct of Mukhtar Pacha, and that it
                            is only awaiting a favourable moment to recall the Ghazi. The letter
                            goes on to say that General Ahmed Djelaled- din Pacha—who it will be
                            remembered took refuge in Egypt two years ago, fleeing from
                            Constantinople, where he was occupying the high but evidently unsafe
                            post of chief of the Sultan’s secret police—will be appointed
                            successor to Mukhtar Pacha.</p>
                        <p>We are in a position to state that Ahmed Djelaleddin Pasha was
                            approached by the Sultan five or six months ago with the object of
                            finding oat whether he would accept the post in question, bat
                            evidently an understanding could not be reached in this respect
                            between Abdal Hamid and his rebellions subject.</p>
                        <p>Since then, and up to a very recent date, a regular state of
                            hostilities has existed between former master and servant. Whether
                            the Sultan has again extended the olive branch in the shape of a
                            renewal of his former offer to Ahmed Djelaleddin Paoha, of whom he
                            stands in dread for many reasons, and whether the Pacha is disposed
                            to come to terms with him on the basis in question—which would
                            surprise us—we do not know. What we do know, however, is that the
                            post of Ottoman High Commissioner ceased to exist in the eyes of the
                            British and Egyptian Governments from the day that Sir H. Drammond
                            Wolff left Egypt as a result of the breakdown of the convention
                            which Great Britain sought to conclude with Turkey through his
                            intermediary for the settlement of the Egyptian Question.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan may appoint a successor to Mukhtar Pasha, and call him
                            also High Commissioner, speeding even more of Turkey’s money than
                            heretofore ou his salary, bat whoever the gentleman may be he will
                            not be recognized in/the above capacity by the Anglo-Egyptian
                            authorities any more than Mukhtar Pacha has been.</p>

                        <p>Bishop Potter, of New York, was a few days ago the guest of "The
                            Pilgrims” at a dinner given at the Hotel Cecil, London. In reply to the
                            toast of "The Pilgrims of America and Our Guest,” proposed by the
                            Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop Potter, who is President of the
                            Pilgrims in America, referred to the fact that he had spent the winter
                            in Egypt. He said that after witnessing what Great Britain had done in
                            this country, he did not know whether it would be any comfort for them
                            to know that the American Eagle was going about the streets with its
                            tail between its legs. He was in Egypt 30 years ago, and he had to
                            confess that such a transformation had come to pass that that once dark
                            land was now completely changed. The characteristic that struck him in
                            Egypt was the triumphant and splendid illustration, which the English
                            had given not so much of sympathy as of justice. The rule of former
                            great empires had been based first upon force, then upon what he should
                            call blaster or menace, then upon chicanery, nowadays called diplomacy;
                            but the thing that had made England great wherever she had ruled and
                            colonised was not force or diplomacy, it was Justice. It was the
                            adherence of the individual to his word and the maintenance of integrity
                            in ordinary transactions. He believed profoundly that the future destiny
                            of the human race was in the bands of Anglo-Saxon civilization. </p>
                        <p>In the course of an interview with "Tribune” correspondent, Bishop Potter
                            said; “I have just Returned from Egypt, where you have been doing the
                            best bit of work in your history. The thing which impressed me was that
                            the British officer is as a rule incorruptible. You cannot buy him. The
                            desire to make money is not one of those things which prompts him to do
                            his duty. That is a product of his nurture in the Church of
                            England.”</p>

                            to refloat her have proved unsuccessful. She is now discharging her

                        <p>The report to be presented to the general meeting of shareholders of the
                            Suez Canal Company fixed for to-morrow shows that the receipts from the
                            traffic through the Canal in 1905 were about 2,100,000fr. less than in
                            the preceding year. Considering, however, that the year 1904 was one of
                            the most favourable which the company has had to record, the results of
                            the last financial year, says the report, may be considered entirely
                            satisfactory, and will permit of the dividend being maintained at 14lfr.

                            fund.</p>
                        <p>The total receipts for 1905 amounted to 117,308,l96fr., and the
                            expenditure 40,984,184fr. Daring the year 4,116 ships, representing a
                            tonnage of 13,134,105 tons passed through the Canal, being a decrease of
                            121 ships and 267,730 tons, as compared with 1904. The report goes on to
                            say that, despite the increase in the dimensions of the ships using the
                            Canal, navigation, owing the works carried out, has been rendered both
                            safer and easier, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of ships
                            going ashore. Power is asked to increase from 25,000,000fr. To

                            conclusion in 1901 to meet the cost of improvements, although the
                            directors have hitherto not availed themselves of their authority.</p>

                        <head>AN APPEAL FOR THE TREES.</head>
                        <p>"A Lover of Trees" ( Cairo ) writes as
                            follows :-
                        </p>
                        <p>I shall be glad of a space in your columns in behalf of the trees. Avenue
                            trees in Cairo are a luxury and every year become more precious, as the
                            buildings increase, and each tree oughts to be cherished and given as
                            fair a chance as possible. This I think is not done, and probably
                            through ignorance, the trees are year by year ill-treated. New houses
                            are built and the trees are surrounded with lime and stones, and die, or
                            take their chance as it may be. But the principal evil is the stupid way
                            the trees are chopped and destroyed each year at this season. The men
                            and long ladders arrive, and all the lower branches are sawn, or torn
                            off, and every bit of green, until the tree is bare, its branches bereft
                            of all that make them useful, and beautiful, and it becomes an eyesore.
                            The shade we all long for the tree cannot give, all the lower branches
                            are gone and the upper ones are thin and bare. Go to Ghezireh or the
                            Pyramid road and cast your eye on the trees there. Tall lanky stalks,
                            towering to the sky, bare ugly branches with all the natural clothing in
                            the way of green cut from them, and the shelter from the sun they are
                            intended to give does not exist. The trees look quite indecent, and
                            ashamed of themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Arabs who skin the trees neither know or care what they do, bat think
                            they must take off as much as possible, and leave as little (possibly
                            they are interested in the selling of the wood, or have it as a
                            backsheesh !! ?).</p>
                        <p>There should be someone in authority over these men, someone, I mean, who
                            has a little knowledge, and judgement, about the pruning and catting of
                            trees, cutting out the dead wood, and leaving the young, taking away any
                            branches that interfere with wires, or windows, yet leaving the tree
                            bushy and thick over the roads ; at present it is apparently left
                            entirely to the Arabs, who have orders to cut, and cat they do ; voila
                            tout, and it will soon be, as far as the trees are concerned "Nichts,
                            Rien, Nothing whatever.” 1 know one of these Lebbek tree, which has
                            never been cut,—it is beautiful! It has never had a worm in its bark,
                            and its branches do not seem to break off like the chopped trees do. I
                            have an idea that the worms that destroy these trees would not get into
                            them if they were allowed a more natural growth and to shelter their own
                            stems.</p>
                        <p>"All said and done</p>
                        <p> It’s little I, against a throng. </p>
