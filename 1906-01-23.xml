                    One of the many writers on Africa said some years ago, that throughout the continent, from North to South, there exists some subtle climatic influence which, acting on human nerves, tends to make the people very quarrel - soma This is said  to apply not Only to natives, but more particularly to foreigners. It is, we thick, admitted that the experience  of recent years has quite justified this opinion, by along series of events still so freshly before us that it is not necessary to recapitulate them. The disputed question of most immediate importance is that of Morocco. This question has loomed largely before os for many month’, but it is. probably,, now only a matter of days before some of the results of the Conference of Algesiras will be known to the world. Already there rooms to be a general opinion that although this question has given rise to a good deal of anxiety, an amicable settlement will probably be arrived at We sincerely hope that this will be so, sad we should have been still more pleased if we could have looked forward to the future with a sigh of relief at . the idea that African questions bad subsided fora while But,however s satisfactory may  be the news we all anxiously await from Algesiras. we regret to say that it may not be long before another African question became* acute, and this time if will interest Egypt more nearly than does the question of Morocco. We refer to Abyssinia. For the last twelve years a question has been brewing there which  "pro¬mises to result in a very considerable crop of internatioral difficulties It all began with what would appear at first sight to be almost simple- matter, which, in view of the serious complica¬tions likely to arise from it, merits some
                        in 1893, some friends of the Emperor Menelik expressed the wish to make a railway for him from the Red Sea to hit capital. Hitherto most of the Abyssinian exports were taken in a clumsy sort of way by caravan to the port of Zaila in British Somaliland, for our readers will remember that one of the difficulties of Abyssinian development is that it has no sea. coast of its own, and it results from many rather cunningly devised international arrangements that Menelik has to pass through foreign territory, either French, British, or Italian, before he can get to any ports It might appear to some people that after the successful war which England waged against Abyssinia some, forty years ago, the British Government might have secured this exclusive advantage, for the expedition had been a ‘costly one ; bat so far as we can re¬member the principal result has been that an English nobleman takes his title from the then capital of Abyssinia. We cannot remember exactly what constituted the French title to their part of Somaliland, but at all events they have it, and it includes the port of Djibouti.
                        In 1893 Menelik’s friends were French or acting in French interests, and it naturally occurred to them that it would be a good thing to make a railway from Djibouti, and thus take away the trade, with its large prospect of future development, from Zaila. The line would then pass for a distance of about 50 miles through French territory. Although this line was expressly intended to be a purely commercial undertaking, and Menelik was naturally anxious to secure the advantages of development which it would open out, he was still cautious enough stipulate that he would wait and see how he got on with his new friends and their railway as far as Harrar, or not quite half way from the sea to his capital, before he gave them any permission to take their line on to Adis Abeba. Subsequent events have shown that be was exceedingly well advised. It would take us much beyond the limits of this article to trace the interesting development of this railway question ; we intend to return to it again in a few days in greater detoil. For the moment we will only summarise in a few words the facts that, as is not unusual in similar undertakings, the railway company got into financial difficulties, the line cost more than was expected it always does,— the company being French, had naturally to appeal to the French Government to get it out of its difficulties, .long negotiations follow- el, ending in the whole thing being entirely converted from a commercial into a political undertaking, and this, "mirabile dicta,”.with¬out it being considered necessary to consult t Menelik about it in any way. Later on the" somewhat meagre funds allotted by the French Government were exhausted, and a New African Company and a New Egyptian Company had to be called to the rescue. Still later Menelik became so disgusted with the conduct of his. friends, that in May, 1905, he convened the representatives of the four European Powers principally interested, and told them very plainly what he thought about the action of the railway company, and added that if be did not very shortly receive some much more reasonable proposals he would make the line himself from Harrar on to hie capital at Adis Abeba' a distance of about 300 miles.
                        Although the “entente eordiale” ‘between England and France did not refer to Abyssiuis we still think that it- would have been of much assistance in bringing matters to an understanding if the question had been I ft to the only Governments much interested in it until quite recently ; we mean those of France, England, and Italy, but unfortunately Germany has now appeared on the scene, and after the not very successful mission of Dr Rosen, is sending a Minister to the Court of the Emperor Menelik, probably with the laudable wish of taking advantage of the rivalries of the other nations. In spite of the rather cool reception he got from. Menelik, Dr. Rosen is said to be determined to acquire commercial equality in Abyssinia, and to assist in the establishment of trade communi-cations between that country and the coast. He apparently does not consider the fact that these communications must necessarily be made through either French, British, or Italian terri¬tory to be of much importance. We must say that we feel much sympathy with the Ethiopeans monarch in his struggles with civilisation, and if he wishes to make his railway line himself, vhy should he not be allowed to do so. if he cau  And perhaps now that fie has a Bank, he may be able- to raise the necessary funds.
