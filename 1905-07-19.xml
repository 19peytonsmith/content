                    <head>RAILWAYS IN THE MARIOUT DISTRICT</head>
                    <p>It is reported that the Daira Khassa of
                    H.H. the Khedive, after completing the ex-
                    tension of the Alexandria-Ain Hammam
                    line to Marsa Matrough vià Sidi Abd el Rah-
                    man, contemplates a further prolongation of
                    the railway to the frontier of Tripoli. Some
                    of our native contemporaries assert that the
                    line will be carried on to Derna from poli-
                    tical moves, and that its extension into
                    Tripoli will enable the Egyptian Government
                    to lay claims to part of Barca should the
                    Tripoli question ever come up for solution.
                    We are sure that if ever the Mariout line
                    passes the Tripoli frontier, the Egyptian and
                    British Governments are certain to press no
                    claims for the ownership of Barca against its
                    present rulers or the European Power which
                    is most likely to succeed them. The rela-
                    tions between Egypt and England on the one
                    hand and Italy on the other are far too
                    friendly for such an idea to be entertained.
                    The friendship of Italy is worth many Barcas
                    and Tripolis, and we strongly deprecate the
                    publication of political prophecies which are
                    liable to cause a certain amount of alarm
                    among our more nervous Italian contempo-
                    raries. In any acase the assent of the Sultan
                    of Turkey is required before any idea of
                    railway extension across the vague frontier
                    of Barca can be entertained.</p>
                    <p>But setting aside the question whether a
                    line from Matrouh to the frontier would pay,
                    we are of the opinion that there is another part
                    of the Mariout country where a railway is very
                    much wanted. A line from Amriya or Sidi Abd
                    el Kader to Gheta or Kom el Hanish would
                    link the Daira Khassa's Mariout line with the
                    Delta Light Railways, and by opening a large
                    district to trade would bring a considerable
                    amount of traffic both to the Daira Khassa and
                    to the Light Railways. The line suggested
                    would have no engineering difficulties to
                    encounter on the 30 kilometres of its course,
                    and would serve some 80,000 feddans irrigated
                    in part from the Nubarieh and Hagir Canals
                    and in part bearing a rain crop. The barley
                    grown in this area is in great demand for
                    brewing, and the construction of this line would
                    without doubt stimulate its production and
                    induce proprietors in the rain crop areas
                    to adopt certain agricultural measures such
                    as the sinking of wells and the storage
                    of rain water in cisterns which the district
                    greatly needs. We may add that the land-
                    owners in this district hold their proper-
                    ties by titles granted them by the decree
                    of 1884, while too many proprietors in other
                    parts of the Mariout country have bought
                    from the Bedouins what was not theirs to sell,
                    and in many cases have never had their titles
                    recognized by the Egyptian Government. FOr
                    some time past certain exporters of barley
                    and landowners in the above-mentioned
                    district have been discussing the possibility of
                    opening a motor car service between Amriya
                    and Kom el Hanish. In our opinion the
                    construction of a light railway would be more
                    useful for the development of the country and
                    preferable from many points of view. Perhaps
                    the Daira Khassa or the Delta Light Railway
                    Company will step into the breach. The
                    construction of such a line should, we think
                    be as easy from the engineering as it should be
                    profitable from the commercial point of view.</p>

                            <p>The Emir el Hag's report on the pilgrimage
                            of 1904 contains some interesting references
                            to the deceased Cherif which we quote in full
                            The first deaals with the robberies and assaults
                            committed on Egyptian pilgrims by the
                            moutawefs and auxiliaries of the Cherif:-</p>
                            <p>"I had to write on this matter to the Wali
                            and the Cherif. They replied by denying these
                            facts, and as I offered to prove them officially,
                            the Cherif replied that it was not my business
                            to interfere in questions concerning the
                            pilgrims. When I wanted to set their com-
                            plaints before him he likewise answered that I
                            had no right to interfere, and kept on repeating
                            the phrase over and over again."</p>
                            <p>Another passage reveals the Cherif in an
                            even less amiable light:-</p>
                            <p>"In an interview with the Cherif I learned
                            that he wished we should follow the Rabigh
                            route instead of that to Yambo. I pointed out
                            to him that this change could not be made
                            without the authorisation of the Egyptian
                            Government. Moreover the Wali had no offi-
                            cial orders on the subject of the change of
                            route recommended by the Cherif, but only
                            letters from the Governor of Yambo in which
                            it was stated that there was not sufficient
                            water at Yambo. I learnt that the route chosen
                            by the Cherif was long and infested by evil-
                            doers."</p>
                            <p>The Cherif recently received letters from
                            the Imam Yahia of the Yemen, which perhaps
                            explains his death, a Turkish garrison being
                            stationed at Mecca.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday's plague bulletin records three
                        fresh cases at Alexandria, one of which
                        was fatal. One of the two cases admit-

                        maid servant employed in a house near
                        Rosetta road, the other is that of a native girl
                        living at Kom el-Shougafa. The fatal case
                        was that of the latter's uncle, who was found
                        dead at his house in Kom el-Shougafa. one

                        <head>THE DRAINAGE QUESTION.</head>
                        <p>The question of sewage disposal (says the
                        "Time" Alexandria correspondent), which has
                        for some time been occupying the attention
                        both of the Cairo and Alexandria authorities,
                        is likely to increase rather than to diminish in
                        importance in the future. Alexandria, of
                        course, possesses a natural receptacle from
                        the effluvia which prevail over thew town, to a
                        greater or less extent, for 300 out of the 365
                        days of the year. The evil will undoubtedly
                        be minimised by the work of laying a large
                        outfall drain to serve the Greek quarter and
                        neighbourhood east of the town, upon which
                        themunicipal authorities areat present engaged.
                        This outfall is laid along the most of the old
                        Rosetta gate fortifications, and it connects
                        with the principal sewer circling the east bay
                        beneath the new quay esplanade. Further
                        extensions will probably be required to render
                        the treatment radically effective.</p>
                        <p>It may seem remarkable (adds the corres-
                        pondent) that Cairo, a city of three-quarters of
                        a million inhabitants, should be without an
                        organised system of drainage; yet such is the
                        case. Moreover, the health of the town exhibits
                        no symptom of being unduly affected by this
                        circumstance, owing, in great part, if not
                        altogether, to the admirable service of the
                        limited company that effects the sweage
                        clearances of Cairo generally. The company
                        has established a sweage farm in the desert
                        near Abbassieh, where it converts the waste
                        matters collected into various artificial ma-
                        nures. Periodically, reformers return to the
                        question of a system of urban sewage; but
                        financial considerations, coupled with the ad-
                        mitted efficiency of the present method, have
                        hitherto deterred the Government from taking
                        action, and may continue so to do for an
                        indefinite period. Sir William Willcocks is
                        believed to compute the cost of the initial and
                        partial installation at a sum approaching a
                        million sterling, and the annual expense of
                        upkeep at about £20,000.</p>

                        an old Greek, after visiting the Greek Hospital,
                        where his wife lay ill, went to Ibrahimieh for a
                        bathe. While swimming he was taken out by
                        the current and was soon in grave danger.</p>
                        <p>There were about 50 or 60 people bathing
                        close by, none of whom appeared to have
                        thought of attempting a rescue, or indeed of
                        doing anything, with the exception of a Greek

                        Luckily a British soldier riding past at the

                        threw off his clothes, and resued the drowning
                        man, who had lost consciousness. The soldier
                        revived him, and, having refused to give his
                        name or accept even a cognac, dressed and

                        wilderness of Lambeth factories."</p>
                        <p>We do not know how much of this is true,
                        but we are inclined to the belief that some
                        considerable time must yet elapse before the
                        mosque can be constructed, as the estimated
                        cost of this structure is £25,000, and of this but
                        a small amount has been collected so far.</p>
                        <p>The plan of the edifice and its style of archi-
                        tecture have been designed by Mr. Robert
                        Williams, F.R.I.B.A. Architect, of Clifford's
                        Inn, who is now in Alexandria, but leaves for
                        London on Saturday next.</p>
                        <p>It is said that his Highness the Khedive,
                        during his late visit to England, displayed the
                        greatest interest in the idea, and has promised
                        to give it every support.</p>
                        <p>The Ameer of Afghanistan has also lavishly
                            contributed £1,000 and it is expected that the
                        Shah of Persia will display his usual lavish
                        generosity in making this fairy-like structure
                        the most beautiful in Europe.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the proselytising scheme it
                        may be said that many Europeans have already
                        embraced the faith, and the gatherings of the
                        Pan-Islamic society are remarkable for the
                        variety of nationality evidenced by their
                        attendance.</p>
                        <p>The society takes a much broader view of
                        the religion than the sterner or stricter sect in 
                        the Orient do, and do not insist on certain
                        rules which, in the stricter faith, are as neces-

                        Exhibition is shortly to be held in Cairo and
                        Alexandria, and we welcome the project as
                        tending to further the commercial relations
                        between this country and Great Britain.
                        Some such stimulus is needed in view of the
                        obvious fact that the increase of English
                        imports into Egypt has not kept pace with
                        the recent marvellous expansion of the trade
                        of the country.</p>
                        <p>We understand that the idea of holding the
                        exhibition is receiving a good deal of support,
                        and it is hoped that the venture will meet
                        with the success it deserves.</p>
                        <p>We shall give further particulars of the exhi-
                        bition as plans mature. Meantime, we may
                        state that the consent of the Alexandria
                        Municipality has been obtained for holding
                        the exhibition in the "French Garden" in
                        Mohamed Aly-square, provided the French
                        authorities are agreeable. The promoters

                        blocked by three large portable asphalt
                        furnaces on which no lantern whatever was

                        and the inhabitants of all the houses in the

                        The asphalt is detained for a neighbouring

                        <p>CAIRO'S WATER SUPPLY.-The recent report
                        of Professor H. Bitter, director of the Hygienic
                        Institute of the Sanitary Department, on the
                        quality of the water supply of Cairo, must
                        have reassured a great many people on a sub-
                        ject which is so important in a tropical climate.
                        The water (vide the report) is of splendid
                        natural quality, and the dwellers of Cairo must
                        congratulate themselves on being the happy
                        possessors of such a valuable asset to their
                        health. The fact of the water supply being so
                        excellent will go far to enhance the reputation
                        of the Capital as a winter health resort and
                        ought to give a great impetus to the tourist
                        traffic. The mineral waters of Mr. N. Spathis
                        of Cairo and Alexandria, are manufactured
                        from this water, their purity and wholesome-
                        ness being therefore practically guaranteed by
                        public analysis. Any further recommendation
                        in favor of Spathi's mineral waters is need-
                        less, as not only is the water guaranteed, but
                        all ingredients used are of the highest grade
                        and are obtained from first-class English firms
                        of known and tried reputation.</p>

                        ulema, sheikhs, and students, of orphans
                        whose greatest benefactor was the deceased
                        Sheikh, must have realised the grief that
                        overwhelmed the whole assembly. The great
                        Sheikh defended the cause of Islam by his life
                        and writings, boldly meeting those who assert-
                        ed that Islam was opposed to progress, and
                        proved that Islam was no obstacle to social
                        progress or to prosperity in this world or the
                        next. We have not forgotten his articles
                        refuting the contentions of M. Hanotaux
                        and others who asserted that Islam was a decadent
                        faith...We have heard that the Governor

                        <p>The Canadian Commercial Agent at Yoko-
                        hama reports that a Japanese association has
                        been recently formed in Tokio, under the style
                        of the "Menka Saibai Kyokai" (Cotton Planta-
                        tion Society), with the object of encouraging
                        the cultivation of cotton. It has been decided
                        as a first step to make experimental cultivation
                        in Korea, and experts and labourers will be
                        sent to the peninsula shortly. The selection of
                        experts has been entrusted to the Department of
                        Agriculture and Commerce. The Government,
                        it is said, fully approve of the work of the
                        association, and their assistance is promised as
                        far as possible. Considering the large amount
                        of raw cotton wich Japan is annually import-
                        ing, principally from the United States, it is
                        not surprising that the Japanese should turn
                        their attention towards its cultivation. There
                        are large tracts of land in Korea well adapted
                        to agriculture, and the climatic conditions of
                        the peninsula are, it is stated, not unsuited for
                        plantations of cotton.</p>

                        recent presentation of Senior Sergeant-Major
                        Rule, of the Yeomen of the GUard, to Prince
                        Arisugawa, for the old soldier was Sergeant0
                        Major of the Lancashire Fusiliers, then the
                        XXth Regiment in the early sixties, when its
                        2nd Battalion was sent to Japan in conse-
                        quence of an attack on the British Legation at
                        Jeddo.. An article on the subject in the "Lan-
                        cashire Fusiliers' Annual" recalls the fact that
                        in that year a review of the British troops
                        forming the Yokohama garrison was held.
                        The Japanese troops who took part in the
                        parade were clad in chain armour, and as their
                        weapons were swords and bows and arrows
                        they performed their exercises separately.
                        After the review the Japanese were instructed
                        in English drill, and the two properly organised
                        battalions which speedily resulted constituted
                        the beginning of the Japanese Army as we
                        know it to-day.</p>
                        <p>It should be left on record that the officers
                        mainly responsible for their instruction were
                        Colonels Glencross and De la pere Robinson,
                        and an interesting fact is that before the
                        battalion of the XXth left Yokohama in 1866
                        the two Japanese battalions took part in an-
                        other review, which was commanded by
                        General (then Colonel) Browne. Viscount
                        Hayashi, whose attention has been called to
                        the matter by Sir Lees Knowles, M.P., has
                        sent a reply which appears in the "Times,"
                        saying how well he remembers that some of his
                        old friends used to go to be instructed in drill.
                        There is some justice in the claim that the
                        parade ground of the XXth Regiment was the
                        birthplace of the Japanese Army.</p>
