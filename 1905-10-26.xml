                    <p>AN ANGLO-RUSSIAN ENTENTE</p>
                              <p>Our London Correspondent informs us by telegram that negotiations 
                              are about to be 
                              opened with a view to the conclusion of an
                              Anglo-Russian understanding, aiming at the 
                              maintenance of the status quo in Asia, and the
                              restoration of Russia to her old and true
                              position as a European Power. The return
                              of Count de Benckendorff to St. Petersburg 
                              and of Sir Charles Hardinge to London, is
                              interpreted as a sign that definite suggestions
                              as to the extent and nature of this agreement 
                              have been put forward by the Governments
                              involved, and are being communicated to their
                              respective ambassadors. It remains to be
                              seen whether the conclusion of any such agree-
                              ment is in reality fessible. Nothing is im-
                              possible in diplomacy. We have seen France
                              and England, at one time bitterly hostile,
                              become firm friends. The relations between
                              Germany and Austria led to an alliance
                              within a few years of the war of 1866, and 
                              to go back to the early years of the nine-
                              teenth century England, after being repeat-
                              edly at war with Spain, became the ally of
                              her erstwhile enemy against the armies of 
                              Napoleon. But in the present case there are
                              certain reasons, as much of a geographical as
                              of a political nature, that must throw consider-
                              able difficulties in the way of any permanent 
                              arrangement with the Russian Empire.</p>
                              <p>A mutual agreement to respect the status
                              quo in Asia is of excellent augury for the im-
                              mediate future of the British and Russian Asiatic
                              Empires, but, in the nature of things, it is un-
                              likely to be permanent, if Russia is to find no
                              outlet on the open sea in Europe. Russia's 
                              whole foreign policy aims at reaching the open
                              water : an Anglo-Russian agreement concern-
                              ing Asia leaves two courses open to the Rus-
                              sian Government. It may "mark time", till its
                              strength has been restored, or it may make its 
                              influence felt once more in the Bulkans, with

                        Mediterranean at the expense of Austria or even of Turkey, which is,
                        after all, the leading Moslem Power.
                        An Anglo-Russian understanding, then, must
                        be of a purely pacific character, and will in
                        substance be nothing more than an affirmation,
                        on the part of Russia, of the Anglo-Japanese 
                        Treaty. It is to be regretted that in the present 
                        state of popular feeling on both sides of the
                        North Sea, such an understanding may be
                        regarded as an attempt to isolate the German
                        Empire. We cannot believe that any such
                        meaning is to be attached to an essentially
                        pacific agreement, but it is very possible that
                        the German Foreign Office may be rendered 
                        somewhat uneasy by the idea. It would be a strange
                        consequence of the proposed under-
                        standing if it hastened the formation of a great
                        central European league, for the Austro-
                        Hungarian conflict is quite likely to subside
                        the instant that Russian influence once more
                        makes itself felt in the Balkans; Roumania
                        may well be forced to ally herself yet more
                        closely with Germany and Austria from a fear
                        of the Slava. and the Sultan may see in friend-
                        ship with such a league his only guarantee for
                        the future against the might of Russia.</p></div>

                        <head> THE TSAR AND HIS PEOPLE</head>
                        <p> The Imperial manifesto issued last week 
                        at St. Petersburg (says the "Globe") is quite a 
                        model of frankness, and so far as that merit
                        goes, it deserves the warmest appreciation.
                        Candid admission is made at the very begin-
                        ing that the Russian Empire has suffered 
                       "sore trials and blows of Fate in a sanguinary
                        war," and Japan is lauded as "a brave and mighty 
                        enemy." Hopes are further expressed that Russia 
                        and her late foe will, for the future,
                        live in peace and neighbourliness in Eastern
                        Asia, heartily co-operating in the develop-
                        ment of that very backward region. As the
                        Mikado had previously expressed that aspir-
                        ation, the present Imperial utterance may be
                        considered in the light of a hand-shake. But
                        even of greater consquence is the passage in
                        which the Tsar pledges himself to convene some sort of a 
                        Parliment to help him
                        in the gigantic and ever-growing labour
                        of promoting the welfare and prosperity 
                        of his subjects. There is no reserva-
                        tion whatever ; the undertaking, if carried
                        out, cannot fail to impair, if not to destroy,
                        the Autocracy. But the Bureaucracy and other
                        privileged classes have shown, again and
                        again, as much adroitness as unscrpulousness
                        in covertly setting at nought the expressed
                        desires of their Monarch. For the moment, the
                        Tsar commands the situation, but the fell
                        shadow behind the Throne is not in the least
                        obliterated or even attenuated. Judging from
                        past experiences, elaborate pretences will be
                        made of loyal obedience to the Imperial Com-
                        mand, but unless the Tsar shows more master-
                        fulness than on previous occasions of the sort,
                        it is a safe prophecy that he will again be as
                        clay in the hands of the potter. He has 
                        unhappily gravitated to the position of a really 
                        powerless despot, who is made the scapegoat
                        when things go wrong.</p></div>

<head>ALARMING SITUATION.</head>
<p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 25.</p>
<p>Eight, thousand railway men have met here
and decided on a general strike to-day on all
the railways serving St. Petersburg. The men
of the Vistula railroads struck at midnight
The railway strike at Moscow is spreading in
every direction, involving a dozen of the prin
cipal towns.</p>
<p>The railway men have sent a deputation to
M. Witte, declaring that the only remedy for
the present situation is political liberty, and
the convocation of a National Assembly elect-
ed by direct universal suffrage. Enough blood
has already been shed in Manchuria and in
the cities of Russia.	(Reuter)</p>

<p>LODZ, October 25.</p>
<p> Thirty thousand workmen in the factories
struck yesterday. The strike is political in
character. The proclamation of martial law is
imminent.(reuter)</p>

<p>St. Petersburg, October 25.</p>
<p>The city is completely cut off, except by
telegraph. Sir C. Hardinge has been unable to
leave. The gravity of the situation is hourly
asserting itself. The whole state of the muni-
cipal organisations is dislocated by ramifica-
tions of the strike movement, which, it is
believed, owes its origin, to a great extent, to
the intensity of the discontent at the inade-
quacy of the proposed reforms.</p>
<p>M. Witte, replying to the deputation of
railway employes, admitted the justice of some
of their demands, while others were absolutely
unrealisable ; such, for example, as that of
universal suffrage, which is inspired by outside
influences. He promised the liberty of the
press and meeting. The deputation was disap-
pointed. A meeting of the railway employes
and students was subsequently held at the
University. Revolutionary speeches were deli-
vered.</p>
<p>Rioting and looting are reported from Riga.
There are many killed and wounded. (Reuter)</p>

<p>London, Wednesday Oct. 25.</p>
<p>The statement published in the home press
to the effect that the negotiations between
Russia and Germany have resulted in a rap-
prochoment is untrue ; but it is quite correct
that the negotiations now in progress both in
London and St. Petersburg are about to assume
definite shape. Sir Charles Hardinge’s return
to London and Count de Benckondorff’s return
to St. Petersburg are connected with the pour-
parlors which are necessary before a complete
understanding can be reached, and which it is
probable will have as its object an entente on
the maintenance of the status quo and the
development of commercial interest in Asia,
together with the resumption by Russia of be
former role as a European Power.</p>

<head>THE KHEDIVE.</head>
<head><DEPARTURE FROM ALEXANDRIA.</head>
<p>At 7.30 a.m. to-day H.H. the Khedive’s
train steamed out of Moharrem Bey station
to the accompaniment of the salutes fired by
the Kom el Dik guns.</p>
<p>The station was crowded at an early hour
by holders of special invitations to witness the
departure of his Highness for Cairo. Among
those present were Mahoud Sidky Pasha,
Governor of Alexandria, Adniral Sir R. M.
Blomfield, Chitty Bey, Cobbe Bey and other
important officials, theulema and the heads
of the various religious communities, and a
great number of native European notables.
The Streets had been decorated and were
thronged with sightseers, and a strong con-
tingent of boy musicians form the Moslem
charitable schools was drawn up in Cherif
Pasha-street. They played the Khedivial hymn
and uttered the Turkish salute of “Efendimiz
chok yashs,” as the Khedive drove up to the
station in the company of H.H Prince Aziz 
Pasha Hassan, escorted by well-mounted
trospers and followed by carriages containing
the Ministers (of whom T.E. Boutros Pasha
Ghali and Hussein Pasha Fakry came up
from Cairo yesterday) and the principal officials
of the Maieh Sanieh.</p>
<p>On the arrival of the Khedivial carriage at
the station of Governor of Alexandria and 
the commander of the British forces at Alex-
andria, with a number of native European
notables, met the Khedive, while the guard
of honor, composed of three officers and a
hundred men of the 3rd Battalion and a 
detachment of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers,
presented arms, and the bands played the
Khedivial salute.</p>
<p>After bidding a hearty farewell to many of 
those present to see him off, H.H. the Khedive
entered the train, followed by the Ministers
and his s ute, and at 7.30 a.m. the thunder of
guns from Fort Kom el Dik proclaimed the
news of the Khedives departure for the 
Capital.</p></div>

                <div type ="item">
<head>ARRIVAL AT CAIRO</head>
<p>Long before H.H. the Khedive’s train was
 due to arrive in Cairo, small knots of people
began to collect in and around the Bab el
Hadeed Station, and at a quarter-past eleven
the crowd was considerable; but the approach-
es were kept clear by mounted and foot
police for those who had been honored with
an invitation to meet his Highness on the
arrival platform.</p>
<p>The station presented a very gay spectacle 
with its abundant display of the Ottoman
flag and decorated shields, and the route
along which his Highness passed as he drove
to Abdeen Palace was plentiful decorated
in a similar manner, but the varied colours
of the many nations flags which hung from
the larger buildings, afforded a welcome 
relief to the predominant red.</p>
<p>Shortly after eleven o’clock a guard of 
honor, composed of three officers and 100
non-commissioned offers and men of the
3rd Battalion, with the battalion colour and
the Cavalry Band, was drawn up inside the
station, while outside the station, in front
of the main exit, the Army of Occupation
provided a guard of honor, composed of one
captain, three subalterns, and 100 rank and
file of the 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling
Fusiliers, with the battalion colour and band.
Punctually at half-past eleven the Khedividal
train entered Cairo station and drew up at
platform No. 2 Major L’Estrange John-
sto, Capt. Blakeney, Mr. Bain, M. Barois,
and Mr. Crossby ac compained the train
from Alexandria, Mr. Crossby being in charge
of the engine.</p>
<p>As his Highness stepped from the carriage 
the colour of the 3rd Battalion was dipped
in salute and the Cavalry Band played the
Khedivial anthem, while a salute of 21 guns
was fired from the open space between Pont
Limoun and Bab El Hadeed stations.
Shaking hands with all those who had come 
to meet him, the Khedive gradually made
his way to the main exit, and as he descended
the steps he was saluted by the guard of honor
of the 2nd R. Inniskilling Fusiliers and
the playing of the Khedivial anthem by the
battalion band, after which his Highness
stepped into his carriage and, preceded by
his Body Guard, drove through the crowded
streets to Abdeen Palace.</p>
<p>Among those present en the railway plat-
form we noticed H.E. Mustapha Pasha Fehmy,
and the Ministers, who came up from Alex-
andria with the Khedive, Sir Vincent Corbet,
Mr. Machell, Mr. Webb, Mr. Dunlop, H.E. the
Sirdar and officers of the Egyptian Army
Brig. Gen. Bullock, C.B., and officers of the
Army of Occupation. Ramadan Pasha, Baghcs
Pasha Nubar, Sir Horace Pinching, Me. Carton
de Wiart, Capt. Blakeney, Mr. Moberly, Mr.
Fosden, Mr. Peacock, and many others.</p></div>

<head>DAIRA SANIEH LAWSUIT.</head>
<head>THE NEXT-OF-KIN OF THE 
KHEDIVE ISMAIL AND THE
EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT.</head>

<p>The following letter appears in the “Times”
of the 18th inst. :-</p>
<p>Sir, I have read your notice of this matter
in your issue of to-day, and ask you to permit
me to make a comment on it on behalf of my
clients, the next-of-kin.</p>
<p>The claimants do not “invoke such preced-
ents as the seigneurial rights over landed
property in Europe during the Middle Ages
by virtue of conquest” in support of their claim,
but to rebut Lord Cromer’s assertion tat the 
Daria Sanieh properties were first acquired by
the Khedive Ismail in an illegal manner,
considering as they do that this assertion is an
aspersion upon their late father’s memory.</p>
                    
<p>The point is, after all, a side issue, but it
has this importance, that if the title of the
Khedivial family be impugned the Egyptian
Government, who can only derive their title
through the Khedivial family (since confisca-
tions are prohibited in the Ottoman Empire
since the Hatti Cherif of Gull Hane (1839),
confirmed by the Hatt Houmayoun of 1856,
and extented to Egypt by the Firman of 1867
constituting the Egyptian Viceroyalty), impugn
their own title</p>
                    
<p>As a matter of fact the Daira Sanieh pro-
perties, for the most part, descended to Ismail
Pasha, as the grandson of Mehemet Ali, the
conqueror of Egypt, before he came Viceroy,
and neither the High Commission of Inquiry
nor the Liquidation Commission (of both of
which Lord Cromer was a member) ever made
any inquiry into the first acquisition of the
Daira Sanieh properties.</p>
                    
<p>The real point at issue is that if the Egyptian
Government have any title at all they must
have derived it through Ismail Pasha, and
that if there ever was any transfer or even any
promise to transfer by him it was for a specific
purpose only—namely, that the deficit which
then existed might be wiped out.
It is interesting in this particular to give 
Lord Cromer’s words uttered at the sitting of
the High Commission of Inquiry of August 7,
1878, in extenso. They are as follows:-
“Mr. Baring thought that the Commission
should decide as follows.:-</p>
<p>1. The amount of the deficit is such a sum.
2. The Khedive is personally responsible for
the present situation.
3. He has lands acquired in an irregular 
manner.
4. He should restore them to the State to
an amount sufficient to meet the deficit.”
The next-of-kin claim that, the deficit hav-
ing been met, the surplus should revert to them.</p>
<p>May I, in conclusion, point out that the
opinion expressed by the legal adviser your
correspondent speaks of (really the Legal
Department of the Egyptian Government) is 
not shared by the advisers to the next-of-kin.
They take a diametrically opposite view, and
including, as they do, the late Mr. Waldeck- 
Roussean, M. Poincare, and others, their opinion
is equally entitled to weight.</p>
<p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant, 
H. ERNEST GARLE, Solicitor to the next-
of-kin.</p></div>

<p>On Monday evening, at about 10 o’clock,
an Englishman, while walking between the 
Canal Company’s offices and those of Messrs
Worms, was knocked down by three Greeks,
after a short but sharp scuffle. The Englishman 
managed to draw a revolver which he carried,
whereupon the three men immediately decamp-

<head>MR. MACHELL’S ENGAGEMENT.</head>
<p>The marriage between P.W. Machell 
and Countess Victoria Alice Leopoldine Ada
Laura Gleichen, daughter of Princess Victor
of Hohenlohe- Langenburg and the late Prince
Victor, who died in 1891, will take place at
the Chapel Royal, St. Jame’s Palace, on De-

be spent at Wollaton Hall, Notts, the seat of
Lord Middleton, the bridgeroom’s cousin.</p>
<p>Countess Victoria, who is perhaps better
known to the world as Countess Valda, belongs
to a talented family. She is an accomplished
musician and is the possessor of a beautiful 
and highly-trained soprano-voice. Her only
brother, Lieut.-Colonel Count Gleichen, who
is at present military attache at Berlin, is a 
keen soldier and a successful author ; her 
eldest sister, Countess Feodora, has made
name and fame as a sculptor, and her young-

and cattle, and bids fair to follow in the foot-

<head>MUSTAPHA PASHA KAMEL
INTERVIEWED.</head>
<p>In a conversation with a representative of
the well-known French daily “La Libre Parole,”
Mustapha Pasha Kamel stated that France
had lost much by her agreement with England.
French statesmen had promised to support 
Egypt but they had cancelled their valuable
promises of support, and in consequence France
had lost her influence in Egypt. The Anglo-
French agreement, in which English states-
manship shone, was a warning to the whole
Orient not to trust in France. France had no 
friendly intentions toward two great Mohame-
dan nations, Egypt and Morocco; but Morocco,
which had long been independent, would not be
easily subdued. Even if the Sultan of Morocco
were to submit to French influence— which was
most doubtful- his people would never submit.
France should consider the consequences of her 
action.</p></div>

is causing considerable anxiety to coal merchants
at Alexandria, who find trade suffering gravely
from the want of wagons. The increase of

<head>THE ZOO’S LATEST ADDITIONS.</head>
<p>Two giant toads have just arrived at the
Ghizeh Zoological Gardens from South Ame-
rica. They are more than four times the size
of the ordinary toad or frog of this country,
and have wonderfully beautiful eyes like glow-
ing precious stones. Apparently, during their
long voyage of several weeks from their native
country they refused all food. On the first day
of their arrival at Ghizeh they continued their
self-imposed fast, but on the second day one 
of these enormous batrachians seized and
swallowed three live young rats in the space 
of five minutes, and then settled down to a
meal of earth-worms, which is expected to
form their usual diet during their stay in
Egypt.</p>
<p>The director of these gardens, Captain S.S.
Flower, has just returned from Europe, after
an absence of seven weeks, and has brought
with him a number of new animals for the

West Africa, not represented previously in
