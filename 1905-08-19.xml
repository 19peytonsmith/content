                    <p>It is comforting to learn that one of the two</p>
                    <p>great dangers which have been assailing the cotton-industry of England and
                        placing it in such a critical situation has, for the moment at any rate,
                        been averted. We refer to the strike which was threatened by the workmen’s
                        demand for a five per cent increase of wages and by the masters’ refusal to
                        accede to their request A Reuter’s telegram received last night from
                        Manchester, however, informs us that the conference which was convened by
                        the Lord Mayor has effected a compromise, by which the operatives are
                        conceded a bonus of five per cent for twelve weeks, and neither side is to
                        take any action before March of next year. The question therefore remains
                        un-decided and is only temporarily shelved, but it is to be hoped that when
                        the alloted time has expired, the two interested parties will be able to
                        establish a more effective and more lasting agreement An open rupture
                        between the cotton-spinners and the operatives would entail an enormous
                        disaster, for not only would it render millions of spindles idle, and
                        necessitate the loss of employment to thousands of workmen, but thousands
                        would suffer along with them, and the bread would be taken out of the mouths
                        of their wives and children, who have no share in the decision of those upon
                        whom their lives depend. A strike of such magnitude would of necessity cause
                        acute suffering and immense loss, especially in the great industrial and
                        thickly populated centres of Lancashire, while it could not fail to have, in
                        a somewhat lesser degree, a disastrous effect in many other centres not
                        directly connected with the cotton trade. The temporary settlement cf the
                        difficulty is therefore a great blessing and gives one ground for sub-</p>

                        possible. Should both master and workman approach each other in a spirit of
                        conciliation and forbearance, we feel assured that the danger would be
                        permanent ly removed. </p>
                    <p>Unscrupulous speculators constitute the other great danger to the
                        cotton-industry of England. How grave is this outside danger from
                        speculative rings, is made clear by the anxiety of the International
                        Federation of Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers’ Associations, which
                        hurriedly convened a meeting at the end of lost month, feeling that common
                        and immediate action was necessary "to counteract the pernicious effeot on
                        the trade, brought about by the late enormous enhancement of the price of
                        raw material” by speculative syndicates. These rings are now paralysing the
                        industry in almost as pro-nounoed and as complete a fashion as was the case
                        a few years ago. We are inclined to think that the only way in which English
                        spinners can free themselves from the ever-tightening grip of these
                        unscrupulous gamblers and “cor-nermen” is to give a greater support to all
                        projects for cultivating cotton in various parts of the British dominions,
                        and so become independent of American grown material. Such a scheme would,
                        however, have to receive far greater support than is at present being
                        accorded it, as under no other conditions could an British scheme
                        successfully compete with the growers of the Southern States America. Here,
                        however, Egypt comes to the help of England, for the cotton grown in this
                        country is steadily increasing in bulk, and it holds a foremost position as
                        regards quality. The European cotton industry is now, it transpires, engaged
                        on the average for a period of three to four months ahead, ample supplies
                        being available—sufficient, in fact, to more than meet demands. It is
                        therefore evident, that spinners can as a rule hold aloof from the markets
                        for that period, and in the majority of cases they certainly need not do any
                        buying before the end of October, by which time the new crop will be coming
                        to hand. For two months, therefore, gamblers may be left to “stew in their
                        juice” and “deal as best they can with the conditions to which they have
                        reduced the market.” Such an expedient is at the same time simple and
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>If the policy of “suspension” thus advocated be loyally and widely adopted by
                        cotton-spinners in Europe and America, it will at any rate obviate, as the
                        associations pointed out at their meeting, the danger of the next cotton
                        season commencing with the raw material at the abnormally high prices which
                        now prevail. Should the supply prove less than the demand, there will still
                        be opportunity and time to meet the conditions caused by a shortage. The
                        latest available figures are from the last number of the New York “Journal
                        of Commerce,” which on past prophetic efforts may be credited with
                        foreshadowing the true state of cotton affairs in the United States with
                        remarkable accuracy. The latest synopsis of that Journal makes out the
                        average conditions to be 75.4 percent, against its own estimate of 81.2 for
                        June and 84.4 last year. These figures contrast with the official estimate
                        for Jane, vis. 77 per cent and 84.4 per cent last year, and against 76 per
                        cent. on August 1, 1900, which was the lowest on record during the last 20
                        years on the same date. States covering half the total acreage provide the
                        lowest average, so that a general shortage is probable, though that hardly
                        implies a supply insufficient for the demand, inasmuch as the official
                        report published by the associations' meeting confidently states that the
                        surplus of last year's crop will guarantee a full supply, even in the event
                        of the next crop being small. The danger therefore which is to be feared
                        from the unscrupulous gamblers who form the speculative rings is not,
                        perhaps, so serious as it would appear on the surface, but at the same the
                        situation is sufficiently grave to cause considerable anxiety, and
                        thoroughly justifies any notion which may tend to safeguard the interests of
                        the industry generally from the pernicious influences of those who do not
                        hesitate to create “corners.” Let the cotton spinners therefore judiciously
                        refrain from making purchases before the arrival of the new crop, and by so
                        doing reduce to harmlessness the more acute symptoms which now threaten the
                        vitality of the trade.</p>
