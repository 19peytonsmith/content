                    <head>THE RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION.</head>
                    <p>We feel a considerable sympathy for the Railway Administration at present: it
                        has "oome into money" and is in oonseqnenoe expected to spend lavishly and
                        satisfy a host of different and often oonflioting interests in the minimum
                        of time. The man of mode- rate means and immoderately poor relations who
                        suddenly finds himself in the possession of a small fortune is in a similar
                        qnandary : he cannot satisfy all at once, and if he selects anyone as the
                        first recipient of his bounty, the rest storm and inveigh against favorit-
                        ism, but where the individual would probably abandon his charitable projeots
                        and spend his money stiiotly on himself and hia own family, if any, an
                        administration most per- severe in the thankless tack of endeavouring to
                        content a host of claimants. That every demand can be met is impossible: in
                        Mr. Wells' Utopia, and there alone, are admi- nistrations eternally capable
                        of rising to every situation and of satisfying every claim on tbo part of
                        the pnblio, and in Egypt, as else- where, they must content themselves with
                        relative success and with the pious hope that each year will be marked by
                        fewer com- plaints. </p>
                    <p>After all, the Railway Administration hflg| not been marking time sinoe last
                        year. 8tat«8$ tics have, it is true, beon classed with lies* and qualified
                        lies by the soeptio, bnt it mil take a long time to porsnade ns that some
                        recent calculations that have come to our notice do not mark remarkable
                        progress, and rapid progress too, on the part of this much- criticised
                        administration. The Alexandria Association of Coal Importers no doubt oon-
                        sider themselves aggrieved at the aotual shortage of trucks, but when they
                        remem- ber that other importers have very consider- able claims on the State
                        Railways, and when they realise the true import of the figures which we
                        give, they will without doubt realise that the Administration is doing its
                        beat for them and for the whole country as far as the supply of rolling
                        stock and the endurance of tho personnel admit. </p>
                    <p>Tho total quantity of goods carried from*’ Alexandria by rail in October,
                        1904, which was a very busy month and showed a great increase on the
                        corresponding month in 1903, was 140,000 tons. Last month 177,000 tops were
                        carried, an iucreaso of nearly 38 i %. In October, 1904, there were 7,700
                        trucks available for trafHx, counting each truck of 30 tons capacity as
                        equivalent to three, while 8,700- trucks are now ready, an re- create of 13
                        %, and 1,1(0 new trucks have yet to be delivered. Tho new tracks are coming
                        in, at the rate ot about ten a day. The majority oome from Belgium, some
                        from England, where their oonstraotion appears to be somewhat slow, sinoe no
                        English tracks have yet been delivered. The total number of traok loads of
                        miscellaneous goods leaving the Castoms at Alexandria in October, 1904, was
                        13,300. 93,400 track loads left the port last month, an increase of over 70
                        %, and there was a thirty per oent increase (60,000 tons against 45.0Q0) in
                        the quantity of goods dispatched from the Gabbari goods station. </p>
                    <p>To tarn to thb question of coal, 50,000 tons have been taken np country
                        against 45,000 last year, and while the increase in the coal imports for the
                        year up to date is 8.8 per cent, the quantity taken inland b^ rail in the
                        period oommenoing on January 1 and ending on Ootober 81, shows an increase
                        of 15 per cent Causes which are not under the control of the Railway
                        Administration have prevented the transport of ooal up-country from being as
                        rapid and as oonsiderablo as the coal importers desire. The area planted
                        with ootton has kcreased so enormously that this year there has not Veen
                        enough fodder fjr horses and cattle, and the "tibn" traffic, formerly a
                        negligeable quantity, has increased enormously in importance. Some 850 truck
                        loads of “tibn” were Bent from the Mariout district daring the month, and as
                        the Bteady supply of “tibn” and oereals is of the utmost importance to
                        owners of horses and cattle, we cannot wonder that the Administration had ia
                        cases to give precedence to this traffio. Another canse of tho difficulty of
                        sending coal and other goods up in sufficient quantity is the deoline of
                        boat traffic to and from Alexandria this year.wh ch has been very marked.
                        Finally, is it not possible that the importers have in some cases accepted
                        impossible contracts 1 If this be so, the question arises whether the State
                        ia called upon to supply facilities which would enable snch contracts to be
                        more or less fulfilled. In our opinion the State has no right to spend
                        publio money for suoh a purpose ; to have cspital lying idle for three
                        quarters of the year to save oertain individuals the neces- sity for a
                        little more foreiight and a great deal more storage room, would be false
                        eoonomy, wasteful in itself and unfair to the taxpayer.</p>

                    <p> News received from Rossis tends generally to show that things are getting
                        worse in the capital and provinces, except at Moscow, where the workmen do

                        the determination of the strikers weak- ening. The council of workmen’s
                        delegates at St. Petersburg has resolved to continue the strike
                        indefinitely, scoffing at M. Witte’appeal. Russians are selling Russian
                        securities at any price for foreign gold which they immediately send
                        abroad.</p>

                    <head>SERIOUS COMPLICATION. LUXEMBURG SUCCESSION. GRAND DUKE'S DEATH</head>
                    <p>Luxemburg, November 17.</p>
                    <p>The Grand Dnke of Luxemburg is dead.</p>
                    <p>(Reuter</p>
                    <p>The death of the Grand Duke Adolphus may not improbably lead to serious
                        difficulties,as for some time past, owing to the advanced age or the Grand
                        Duke, the question of the succession has been a matter of considerable
                        concern to Belgium and will possibly become a European question. The late
                        Grand Duke by his two marriages only left one son, Prince William, who is in
                        bad health and has only daughters by his marriage with a Princess of
                        Braganza. The Salio law holds good in Luxemburg, otherwise the Grand Duchy
                        would have passed in 1890 to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland, at the death of
                        her father the late Grand Duke. One feeble life thus stands between
                        Luxemburg and a serious crisis, for Germany it is well known desires to
                        incorporate the little State in the Empire. This, however, could scarcely be
                        permitted by France, who, as long ago as 1867, protested against such an
                        absorption on the part of Germany. Belgium, too, powerless as she is, would
                        view with the greatest objec- tion a German ontpost on her frontiers. The
                        Belgians argue the matter thus: both France and Germany wish to have the
                        Grand Duchy but neither will allow the other to get posses- sion of it
                        without the most serious protests. The obvious solution they say is to give
                        it to Belgium, to whom it belonged until 1839. The two States are closely
                        united in every way, and the annexation oould be carried out without the
                        slightest trouble or disturbance.</p>
                    <p>The late Grand Duke of Luxemburg was born at Biebrich, July 24, 1817, and
                        married, at Dessau, April 23, 1851, his second wife, Princess Adelaide of
                        Anhalt; his first wife, the Grand Duchess Elisabeth Michailovna of Russia,
                        having died in 1845 withont issue. His only daughter, Princess Hilda, was
                        married to the Crown Prince Frederick of Baden in 1885; a grandson of the
                        Emperor William 1., with a settlement of a million sterling. The Hereditary
                        Prince Alexander is likewise an only son, born in 1852, and serves as major-
                        general in the Austrian army. Should his sister die without issue her dower
                        will ultimately revert to him, and he will be one of the wealthiest princes
                        in Europe, his father having possessed, in addition to a fortune of at least
                        three millions sterling, vast estates in Austria and Germany. Prince
                        Alexander married on June 21, 1893, Marie-Anne, Princess of Braganza.</p>

                    <head>railway administration. SOMe INTERESTING FIGURES.</head>
                    <p>The following details regarding the general traffic on the Egyptian State
                        Railways during the past ten months shonld be of some interest to our
                        readers. We understand that during that period 4,884,000 tons of goods of
                        all kinds have been carried, against 8,625,000 durirg the corresponding
                        period last year, an increase of 21 1/2 per cent, though the increase in the
                        carrying oapacity of the rolling stock brought about by the supply of new
                        trucks, etc, only amounts to 13 per cent This increase is the more
                        remarkable in that the traffic to Alexandria has remained almost stationary,
                        while tbe traffic from that piece has increased about 16 per oent and is now
                        more than double that in tbe opposite direction, with the result that quite
                        half the trucks going up from Alexandria have to be sent back empty. The
                        average load of the trucks loaded here has increased from 82 to 84 per cent
                        of their nominal carrying capacity,—a remarkably high figure, as trucks will
                        only take about 60 % of their nominal load when laden with timber and less
                        still when carrying "tibn,” which has now become quite a common article of
                        transport, owing to the great scarcity of fodder and cereals in parts of the
                        country which now grow nothing but cotton, and many other commodities.</p>
                    <p>Though the traffic which does not touch Alexandria is to the Alexandria
                        traffic nearly as 5 to 3, on an average every truck on the Egyptian State
                        lines takes a load out of Gabbary every 12 days. The increase of traffic has
                        resulted in an increase of earnings, the figures working out at about 9s. 1
                        1/2d. per goods train mile against 9s. Od. in 1904. It follows from all this
                        that not only has the rolling stock been increased, but that the
                        administration now gets more work out of each truck than formerly, while new
                        trucks are added as fast as it is possible to get them put together. Up to
                        date every track has on an average run a trip once every three days, and as
                        merchants frequently take a full day to load and another day to unload,
                        while many trips cannot be made in much under two days, it seems obvious
                        that there has been very little margin left for avoidable delays.</p>
                    <p>As for the passenger traffic, for the ten months of 1905 it shows an increase
                        in number of 1,836,000, twelve per cent. more than in 190<unclear/>, a
                        remarkable sign of the increasing prosperity of the country. If this fact be
                        considered along with the increase of goods traffic, which has been most
                        extraordinary, it will be realised that the Railway Administration has had a
                        very heavy task during the present year. There are doubtless some points
                        where improvement is desirable, but it deserves great credit for its
                        success.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA'S NEW QUAY. THE SALES OF LAND.</head>
                    <p>No date has as yet been decided upon for the sales of building land on the
                        new quay at Alexandria. It is to be hoped that the Municipality will soon
                        fix an early date, as the public expectation is very eager and the looal
                        capitalists have for some time past been girding themselves for the fray at
                        the forthcoming sale. </p>
                    <p>The lands must, according to the regulations of the Municipal Free State
                        Lands Department, be revalued every year, and this year’s valuation will be
                        the reserve price of the land. It was thought advisable to have the valtion
                        as and the sales during the winter, when the Municipal Council is at its
                        full and the local capitalists have returned. </p>
                    <p>We have reason to believe that the question of selling the lands will soon be
                        decided by the Municipality. The valuation of the remaining portion of the
                        land can easily be made, and in all,probability it will be put up to anotion
                        early in the year. </p>
                    <p>The most interesting question in regard to the new quay estates is as to
                        whether the centre of the city will be shifted from that part of the Mohamed
                        Aly-square, where is the Bourse, to the great artery of traffic to the quay,
                        which is to be at the Plaoe des Consuls. 1 There will be the Gonvernorat,
                        the Government and Ministerial buildings, etc., and many believe that that
                        part will beoome the hub of Alexandria. But this is a very doubtful theory,
                        for where the Bourse now is will be a far more central, and commerce is
                        notoriously conservative in its movements. The quay will not succeed in
                        displacing Cherif Pasha-street for many years to come.</p>

                    <head>THE MECCA PILGRIMAGE. </head>
                    <p>The Alexandria correspondent of the "Man cheater Guardian" writes as follows
                        to his paper:- </p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Government announces an increased scale of charges to be levied
                        on all Egyptian pilgrims accompanying the Holy Carpet in the approaohing
                        pilgrimage to Mecca. In justification of this measure it is stated that the
                        accounts of the last pilgrimage kept in the Ministry of the Interior
                        disclose a considerable deficit between the receipts derived from the
                        pilgrims and the Governmental expenses. There is no doubt that the cost of
                        this religions obligation is becoming every year more onerons for the
                        individual Moslem. As an example of this fact, if Egypt is not declared free
                        from plague by the time the Hedjaz caravans set out on their journey a poll
                        of £E 50 (?) from every pilgrim is exacted by the regulations of the
                        Sanitary Board of Constantinople for purposes of hygienic supervision and
                        disinfection.</p>
                    <p>The Western world least ot all has cause to criticise regulations such as
                        these, however stringent they may seem, for they are eminently preventive in
                        character, and their observance by the rude Hags who form the mass of the
                        caravans is one of the best guarantees that the former agglomerations of
                        pestiferous humanity —a menace to the well-being of three conti- nents—is at
                        an end.</p>
                    <p>As regards the charges assessed on the pilgrims travelling under the escort
                        of the Holy Carpet, the Bedouin hostilities during the last two pilgrimages
                        more than vindicate the despatch of a strong force, well armed and equipped,
                        for the protection of the caravan. The Egyptian Government can scarcely be
                        blamed for declining to cover the deficit from the funds of the State, since
                        the native taxpayers of Egypt number probably as many Copts as Mussulmans.
                        It is, moreover, questionable whether the pilgrims who journey on their own
                        account and not under military protection fare at all so well in the end,
                        either with respect to individual comfort or pecuniary outlay.</p>

                    <p>Excellent weather marked the opening meeting of the K.S.C.’s 1905-6 season
                        yesterday. The fields were quite good and there were some excellent
                        finishes, especially in the third race, which, after a most exciting
                        struggle, ended in a dead heat. The fourth race was also well contested, as
                        was the fifth and last of the day. Of the owners, Khalil Pasha Khayat opened
                        the season admirably with three wins— one of them a dead heat. Ibrahim Bey
                        Cherif with several horses running, was unlacky. The attendance was
                        moderately good; there was, of course, a marked absence of the tourist
                        element, but a good many well-known residents were present, among whom we
                        noticed the Hon. F. O. Lindley,Gen. Bullock, Mr. Machell, Mr. Mitchell

                        Suheil’s and he won pretty easily, Massoud being a moderate seoond and

                        Peacock drew ahead but Petrone now made a great effort and coming rapidly
                        up, overhauled the leader only to be himself challenged by Hadeed. At the

                    <head>FASHIONS AT GHEZIREH. A WOMAN’S POINT OF VIEW.</head>
                    <p>(Special to the Gazette)</p>
                    <p>With the first meeting of the Khedivial Sporting Club yesterday, the Cairo
                        season of 1905 may be said to commence ; and from a woman’s point of view it
                        already promises well. Certainly there was no dearth of fresh and pretty
                        frocks; snd there were several excellent examples of the prevailing fashion.
                        Naturally one of the most striking figures present Was that of Mrs. Mc Lean,
                        the bride of the moment. She was wearing a fine blue embroidered muslin robe
                        with insertions and under sleeves of white lace, and a large veil of the
                        same hue encircled her wide-brimmed hat. Her mother, Mrs. Royle, was also
                        looking her best in a dark blue spotted silk muslin, made over and relieved
                        with white. Mrs. Crookshank wore white with handsome insertions of white
                        lace. There were many white frocks of course, and some especially handsome
                        ones with edgings and insertions of broiderie anglaise, or very heavy lace.
                        A very handsome French woman was wearing a tight- fitting three-quarter coat
                        of broiderie anglaise, ornamented with large embroidered buttons. The
                        embroidery also appeared at the hem of the well-cut short white skirt, and
                        the hat was made of the same embroidery with masses of pink roses tucked
                        beneath the brim, and an enormous pink veil floating round it.</p>
                    <p>Miss Rees was well turned ont, as usual, and wore a soft grey frock, the
                        short bolero showing lace above the waist line and in the vest. Her lace
                        toque, turned high from the head at one side, was lined with black ; a black
                        feather rested on her pretty hair. Mrs.de Codt had on a trim fitting blue
                        dress adorned with edgings of tightly pleated lace, and there were several
                        dainty frocks of tiny checked taffatas, the prettiest perhaps being in
                        silver grey with tucks and ruchings of the same, and a soft folded waist
                        band of a very soft shade of blue. Mrs.Hunter was in white with black at the
                        waist and black wings in her hat; and with her was her sister, Mrs. Herbert;
                        and also Mrs.Satow, the last mentioned in the palest softest blue skirt with
                        corsage of Paris tinted lace. A very dainty frock of deep ivory voile was
                        adorned with appliques of Oriental design in brown and blue; and with this
                        was worn a large hat of shaded brown with tiny pink roses. Another beautiful
                        gown was of palest champagne coloured cloth, the trailing skirt enriched
                        with lace outlined with mole coloured velvet,which velvet also draped the
                        slender waist and adorned the corsage. Originality was the leading note in a
                        soft white silk lined with heliotrope. The corsage had a small pointed
                        basque, and opened in the front to show the deep pointed and draped ceinture
                        of the heliotrope. Feathers of the same shade appeared on the toque; and
                        indead many shaded ostrich plumes were being worn in accordance with the
                        latest decrees of fashion.</p>

                        on the 8th inat. at CennoD Street Hotel, the Right Hon. Lord Vanx of
                        Harrowden (chairman of the company) preaiding. </p>
                    <p>The Acting-Secretary having read the notice calling the meeting,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman, in proposing the adoption of the report, aaid : We have placed
                        before yen ao detailed and comprehensive a statement cf the work acconn
                        lished to the present time, and the arrangements we have in progress for onr
                        future operations, that there is bnt little that I can add to that
                        information to-day. Yon will realise that we have had a great deal to do to
                        complete onr organisation, situated as we are in a country where the
                        conditions at the outset were far from favorable. When the Bgypt and Sadan
                        Mining Syndicate, from whom we acquired the property we possess, first went
                        into the desert in search of ancient mines, a more inhospitable country tor
                        mining enterprise could scarcely have been lound, but that syndicate was
                        fortunate in the selection cf its men to undertake that exploration, and
                        what appeared to be almost insuperable obstacles to successful work were
                        gradually surmounted, so that by the time negotiations were entered into
                        with the syndicate for ac- quiring its rights over the concession many of
                        the difficulties had been removed, and we had the further satisfaction of
                        knowing that the syndicate had been successful in locating over 30 ancient
                        mines, some of which h**ld out great promise of success. You will bo aware
                        that the concession we control comprises an area of 92,000 square miles—an
                        enormoos territory. Of the mines which bad been so discovered, the Om
                        Nabardi, by reason of its situation within a reasonable distance of the
                        Sudan Government Railway, and the extent of its old excavations, which bad
                        been proved to be on auriferous reefs carrying good shoots of ore, was the
                        one to which it was decided that this company should devote its atten- tion
                        principally at the commencement of its operations. In respect of this mine
                        the Egypt and Sudan Syndicate had obtained from the Sudan Government the
                        promise of a grant of a mining lease of 156 acres for 91 years, renew- able
                        for a further 91 years, and it had also secured the renewal of the
                        prospecting licenoe over the remaining portion of the concession for a
                        further period of three years, endiog on August 31st, 1907, with the right
                        to a further renewal in respect of some ten square miles surrounding the
                        area comprised in the mining lease for four years, renewable for a further
                        jfriod of four years. 8o that you will see, gentlemen, this company entered
                        into posses- sion of the most valuable and extensive rights and privileges.
                        The Egypt and Sudan Mining Syndicate, in the course of its development of
                        the Om Nabardi mine, which had been attend- ed with very gratifying success,
                        had brought the work up to a point at which it had be- come necessary to
                        equip it with machinery for deeper sinking. A difficulty which presented
                        itself in connection with such equipment was the feet that we were 30 miles
                        from the rail- way, and that to trans] ort engines, boilers and other heavy
                        machinery across the desert by camel would be almost impracticable. Your
                        directors therefore determined to construct a light railway from No. 6
                        eta'ion on the Govern- ment railway to the Om Nabardi Mine, the cost of
                        which was provided for in the working capital raised. The order for the
                        railway material and rolling stock was promptly placed, and the rails and
                        one of the locomotives were shipped in October, 1904, a second locomotive
                        following in December. Meanwhile, winding and other engioes, as well as
                        electrical and gas pro during plants tor operating them, also the ne- 1
                        osesary pomps for hauling water from the mine, j were in coorse of
                        construction,and were practi- cally all shipped and at No. 6 station by the
                        I time the railway was completed. The first1 j train through to Om Nabardi
                        was dispatched : | on June 8th last, and naturally ofsointe-j resting and
                        important an event your directors ' were advisod by cablegram, a message
                        which they received with much pleasure and satis- faction. The establishment
                        of this railway had thus removed one of the greatest draw backs which had
                        been encountered in mining on the concession. The cost of the line was not a
                        very serious matter, owing to the flat nature of the country and the few
                        embank- ments and onttings rendered necessary, but had it been far more
                        expensive than it has proved the compeneatoiy advantages would have fully
                        just,lied the outlay. In the pros- pectus the directors put down £16,000 to
                        £20,0(0 a? the possible cost of the work. Wo are glad, however, to state, as
                        you will observe in the balance-sheet, that uptoJone 80th last, when the
                        line was in foil working order, the outlay had only amounted to £13,976 13s
                        lid— (bear, hear)-so that the expenditure was well within the estimate. The
                        ereotion of the winding engines is now being proceeded with, and in the
                        course of three or four months we hope to have the mine well equipped. At
                        No. 6 station a platform has been built and a crane erected upon it. Other
                        surface work has comprised the con- struction of roads, the levelling of
                        ground for the foundations of the machinery, the erection of houses for the
                        staff and the na- tives, etc., eta Wehave also established commu- nication
                        between the Om Nabardi mine and the No. 6 station by means of a telephone,
                        which naturally is a great oonvenienoe.and the 8udan Government has been
                        good enough to erect a post rffioe at No. 6 station and arrange a postal
                        service in connection therewith for thebenefi' of the oompany. With regard
                        to aotual mining developments at Om Nabardi, I do not propose to take up
                        your time for more than a minute or so, as Mr. Robert Taylor, one of our
                        managers, who.is also a direotor of the company, will deal with that matter
                        presently. I would like, how ever, to say that we have good reason to be
                        satisfied with our position' and prospects and t' at there is every
                        indication that the Om Nabatdi mine is going to prove a profitable
                        undertaking. We have now opened op a conti- nuous run of reef for a distauoe
                        of 2,000ft, and expect to find it atorg the remaining distance pf 1.(8 Oft,
                        or 3,000ft in all, which is the length of the Om Nabardi bhek. You will have
                        gathered from onr report and the more detailed report by Mr. Llewellyn
                        annexed to it that valuable shoots of-roln-o leMi’aid open, showing in some
                        in- stances h:g'i a is«y values, and Mr. Llewellyn tel'* ns h it th tendency
                        isfor the reeftoimprovo inva'oeas t is followed downward Ofc)urse,at the
                        pre-ent time our mine is shallow, but we hive already opened op a quantity
                        of payable ere ground, and as soon as we can develop the reef at the 2 0 ft
                        level, which work will bo taken in hand veiy shortly, we expect to very
                        materially inorease our ore reserves. It may be thought by some of our
                        shareholders that, with such good prospects and so great a length of reef
                        proved, we should now erect a battery and gold recovery plant and commence
                        making rotnms without further delay, and the direc- tors would bo it clioed
                        to sympathise to some extent with that view. We would, however, ask you to
                        exercise a little patience in this connec- tion, and leave it to the
                        discretion of the board as to when this matter should be dealt with. (Il8ar,
                        hear.) We may say that it is one which is prominently Wore us, but we are
                        desirous, before erecting a battery, to havp at onr disposal auoh a supply
                        of ore as will ensure its permanent and uninterrupted run- ning, Such a
                        reserve we anticipate the develop ment of the 200 ft level will give us.
                        Until we have a larger quantity of water than onr present operations s fiord
                        it will not be wise to erect the first battery, at all events, on the mine
                        nnd we are therefore contemplating the establishment of our milling plant on
                        the banks of theNi!e,andhave alreadyboeu incommonica- tion with the Sudan
                        Government on theaubjact. In the early portion of my address I mentioned
                        that we possessed rights over 22,000 sqnare miles of country, and that thore
                        have been discovered within the limits of the property over 30 ancient
                        mining sites. We have been so far so mnch occupied with the important works
                        we have had in hand at Om Nabardi that we have not been able to undertake
                        prospecting operations outside that mine, but as soon as our machinery is
                        going and we are in full working order the directors will be able to devote
                        more attention to the other mining centres. Two blocks of about 1,000 square
                        miles each have been snb-let to two exploration companies who have the
                        necessary funds available to thoroughly prospect them. Ono of these
                        companies is the Suakin Mining Syndicate, Limited, and the other the Mysore
                        Reefs and General Explorati n (Jumper y. Limited. In the case of the former
                        we receive for the option £500 in cash, and fnm the latter £1,000 in cash,
                        and in the ev nt of those companies exercising the options this company
                        would receive ir, each ease a furthi r £5,000 in rash, plus 15 percent in
                        folly-paid shares of the nominal capita! of any company formed by them for
                        di vi-’opii g the properties. We are glad to Bay that our 'abour supply
                        continues eati-fec tory, and that some t-f the natives are proving
                        themselves to be excellent workmen. I think I have now touched upon all the
                        material points excepting that ot the balance-sheet, upon which we shnll be
                        glad to answer any questions you may wish to put to us. All the
                        itemsofexpenditure are so olearly set forth that I do not think they require
                        any comme it from me. The financial position is summed up in the fact that
                        we have remaining over £80,000 of working crpital, after providing all the
                        machinery required for the time being and defraying the cost of the
                        construction of the railway, a posi'ion which you will agree with mo is an
                        immensely satisfactory one. </p>
                    <p>Sir Charles Tennant seconded the resolution. </p>

                    <p>Only those who have followed the coarse of Egyptian affairs closely can folly
                        appreciate the great prosperity now prevailing in this country. The
                        improvement in the profits of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank of late years give*,
                        however, some idea of the manner in which matters have progressed. From
                        1887, I the year when the capita! of this bank was . p'_aoed opop its
                        typeent basis, ontil 1896 the I dividends announced rnled between 5 per cent
                        and 6 per ceot., which cannot be considered a 1 b'gh retorn for a bank. From
                        1896, however, they rose steadily, and the distribution for the , yea** bas
                        been 12$ per cent, whilst even then large margins for reserves have ,
                        remained over each year. Thus the profit of £115,108 shown for the twelve
                        months ended August 31 allows of the distribution of 12$ per cent, for the
                        year, the tnn.ftr of1 £30,000 to the pension reserve fnnd, and the inorease
                        in the balance fotward from £15/00 to £'6,0T0. 8* large has been the margin
                        be tween profits earned and dividends distributed that since 1896 the
                        reserve has been raised from £90/100 to £500/)Q0, or an amount equal to the
                        paid np capital, and only a moderate portion of this large addition has been
                        due to premiums upon new capital. It is not snrpris ing, therefore, to find
                        that, having built op the reserve to this excellent position, the board are
                        taming their attention to providing a substantial pension food for the

                        entire capital of th* Bank of Abyssinia, via, 100.000 shares of £5 each, at
                        the prioe-of £7, strikes ps as quite ft successful joke. An attempt appears

                        usually associated with a huge loan isiued by'be Bank of England. In this
                        case however, the National Bank of Egypt appears to cosupy the position both
                        of vendor and promoter, and the details of the scheme, bo far as we can
                        gather them from tb* vary meagre particulars supplied, promiepa very
                        handsome return to that institution if tb* pnbl c think it worth while to
                        relieve them of their interest. The National Bank ot Egypt, it appearsj has
                        obtained frem the Emper. r Menelik a concession to oonstitute the com( pany
                        under a kind of limited liability by-law, and the company has been duly
                        founded nndtr Egyptian law and authorised by Khedj'iel deoree, Menelik beipg

                        capital of the company being, as stated above, 100,000 shares of £5 each.
                        Sir oa that time, we are bound to presume, though we are provided with no
                        data to go upon,' prospects have, so brightened that the Na, tioual Back of
                        Egypt is anxiousr to tell tbq whole lot of the 100,000 shares, upon which
                        25*. has been paid, at theprioe of £7, f wh'cH £2 is premium. This money is
                        to be payable as to £2 10s. on application, 15s. on allotment, I and the
                        briauCfl-Pl £315a. in calls, as required, to the Bank cf Abyssinia. That is
                        to say, the National Bask of Egypt, having paid out 25'. per shire, is
                        anxious to get that sum back! from the pptyio, together with a ly>nu* o' £2,
                        For a business which cannot be said to havq started operations yet these
                        terms strike ns ra be:ng somewhat steep. Certain privilegei are given to the
                        Bank of Abyssinia by the Emproi Menelik, it is true; but we treat we shall
                        not be showing undne respect to that dusky monarrl} if we suggest tbftt the

                        the hearty manner iq which the National Bank of Egypt looks after itself. It
                        is, as the circular shows, anxious to dispose of its entire holding in the
                        undertaking —and at a totally unwarranted premium, too — and at the same
                        time to keep its linger in 'he pie. Ont of the net profits it is proposed to
                        .sot aside 10 pre cent to form the ordinary ree-rve fund, then sufficient to
