                            Suez to Cairo. The Bedouin was suspicious as to the nature of the
                            camels' load and he went to inspect the contents. The two drivers of the
                            camels at once fled. 80 kilos of hashish was found hidden among the
                            straw and the beans. The Bedouin took the camels to Nawa Market, where
                            the police took possession of the hashish. </p>
                        <p>Maltese Benevolent Society.—To-morrow will be the twenty-fifth

                            mass celebrated in the chapel of the Latin Cemetery at 9 o'clock
                            to-morrow morning by the Rev. Father Joseph Vella, Maltese curate, for
                            the repose of the soul of the late Salvo Grech Borg, the promoter of
                            this society. After the mass a memorial stone will be inaugurated over
                            the tomb of Mr. Borg. The advocate Mario Vella will afterwards pronounce
                            a speech as president of the society. The poor families of the colony

                        <p>Mohamed Aly Memorial. — An Egyptian correspondent, writing to a London
                            Contemporary on the celebration of the centenary of Mohamed Aly,
                            remarks:— “The Municipality of Alexandria have proposed, as a public
                            commemoration, the construction of a lunatic asylum. The idea has found
                            but little favor in Egypt, where a work of the kind is regarded as
                            solely the business of the Government, which, indeed, has already
                            decided upon the building of a lunatic asylum, though not in the
                            vicinity of Alexandria. It is unlikely that the Municipality scheme will
                            survive the criticism bestowed upon it, and a more felicitous kind of
                            monument will probably have to be adopted." </p>

                        <head>SAILORS AND SOLDIERS INSTITUTE.</head>

                        <p>Another very successful and most enjoyable concert was held at the above
                            institute on Thursday evening, which, judging from the numerous encores
                            demanded by the audience and so kindly granted by the performers,
                            equalled, if it did not surpass, the former one held a month ago. The
                            well-arranged programme, in which the vocal and instrumental
                            performances were well balanced, was carried out in a most thorough
                            style. The songs of Mrs.Gamble and Miss MunGavin were, as on the
                            previous occasion, highly appreciated, and the pianoforte solos of Mrs.
                            Gordon thoroughly merited the applause accorded to them. Miss M. K.
                            Gibson's rendering of the “Intermezzo" from Caballeria Rusticana was
                            something to be remembered, and was received with one long and continued
                            call for an encore. Which was given in this talented lady’s best style
                            as was also her other, item, with its encore. The mandoline solos of
                            Professor Rizzitano were excellent, exhibiting taste and feeling,
                            combined with faultless execution. Two novelties; in the shape of an
                            imitation of church bell ringing, given by Mr. O. S. Heaton, and a
                            masterly exhibition of club swinging by Gunner S. Hall, R.G.A., made a
                            delightful variation in the entertainment. The recitation by Drummer
                            Peace and the pianoforte solo by Private Russell well earned the praise
                            awarded them, while Mr. Dodwell’s two songs and three encores proved the
                            power of a good comic song, well sung, to amuse both old and young. The
                            proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to the performers, and to Mrs.
                            Lawrence for organising so successlul an entertainment; and although
                            there was no formal vote of thanks given, yet we are sure that all
                            present felt that the success of the evening was greatly enhanced by the
                            admirable manner in which Major Gamble precided. The hall, which was
                            prettily decorated with flowers kindly sent by Mr. John Ross, was well
                            filled with an audience in which the military formed a good proportion,
                            our now friends of the R. G. A. showing a good muster. Amongst those
                            present we noticed Major and Mrs. Gamble, Capt. and Mrs. Gordon, Mrs.
                            Moore, Rev. R. Wormell, Mr. and Mrs. John Ross, Mr. and Mrs. Acres, Mr.

                        <p>June 1 will he an important date in the history of the industrial
                            development of Egypt’s commercial capital for on Thursday next the
                            Rosetta and Alexandria Rice Mills Company will be launched. As is well
                            known, Rosetta for many years past has been the seat of the Egyptian
                            rice industry, and rice milling is in fact the only staple of that
                            interesting but decayed old city of Lower Egypt. There are, however,
                            many disadvantages in this site, for the railway communication with
                            Rosetta leaves much to be desired, and the transport by sea and canal is
                            antiquated, hazardous, and tedious. It is obvious therefore that
                            Alexandria oil era far more scope for dealing with a commodity of such
                            general importance to the inhabitants of Egypt and of the Levant
                            generally, for the trade is developing rapidly every year. </p>

                            persons of Alexandria, Trieste, and Marseilles, have combined together
                            to start the Rosetta and Alexandria Rice Mills Company. The first step
                            will be the erection at Alexandria of what is destined to be by far the
                            largest rice mill in Egypt, and on Thursday next the foundations of the
                            building will be laid. An advantageous site has been chosen on the
                            Mahmoudieh Canal, between the Asphalte Company's works and Messrs. Abou
                            Chanab's oil mills. The superficies of the site is about four feddans,
                            and on this a large six-storey mill and two warehouses will be built by
                            Mr. P. A. Gerakis, the contractor, after the design of Mr. Stienon. </p>
                        <p>The company intends taking over Messrs. Behrend’s rice mill at Rosetta,
                            and the managing directorate will be in the hands of Messrs.Behrend
                            &amp; Company. The capital of the company is £60,000, all of which has
                            been privately subscribed, and there will therefore be nopublic issue. </p>
                        <p>The machinery will be of the very latest description. It will be entirely
                            automatic, and will be capable of turning out one hundred tons of
                            cleaned rice every day, as against an average turn-out of a Rosetta mill
                            of seven to eight tons per day. Every type of rice will be turned out,
                            from the simple decorticated variety to the highly glazed finished
                            article. The wants of the Egyptian fellah will to carefully attended to,
                            and special attention will be directed to the manufacture of the
                            “Maksous” or salted variety of rice, which native consumption specially
                            affects. </p>
                        <p>When the Egyptian rice crop ends about March, the mill will turn its
                            attention to Rangoon rice, which can be imported in either the rough or
                            cleaned state as suits the mill's requirements. In the latter case the
                            cleaned rice would undergo the glazing process. </p>
                        <p>The advantages which the new mill possesses are obvious, and the result
                            will be that the rice trade, which has hitherto been concentrated at
                            Rosetta, must necessarily find its way toAlexandria, and the last nail
                            will be thereby driven in the coffin of Rosetta’s whilom prosperity to
                            the benefit of Alexandria. </p>
                        <p>The mill is to be ready for work in about ten or eleven months’ time.

                        <p>Medinet el Fayoam, Friday.</p>

                        <p>I am glad to be in a position to state that the united efforts of the
                            Parquet authorities and of the officials of the Ministry of the Interior
                            have succeeded in discovering the whereabouts of the valuables stolen by
                            the brigands. They were found in a village hard by the desert that
                            intervenes between the provinces of Fayoum and Beni-Souef. Six men
                            implicated in the brigandage are now under arrest and energetic efforts
                            are being made to lay hands on the brigand chief and other members of
                            his nefarious gang. The Inspector of the Ministry of the Interior and
                            the Moudir of the Fayoum are working day and night to unravel this case,
                            and it is to be hoped that their efforts will be crowned with the
                            success they deserve in bringing the ruffians within the meshes of the
                            law. </p>

                        <p>I fear that matters are not improving in the prospects of the Fayoum
                            Light Railway. I was recently informed by a late employe of the company
                            that there is a decrease of £10 per diem in the receipts of this
                            railway, and he also declared that the present receipts of the line
                            scarce suffice to pay the expenses. Of course I do not vouch for the
                            truth of this information, but all accounts tend to show that the
                            progress of the company is not rapid, nor can its future prospects be
                            characterised as in any degree promising. </p>

                        <head>THE CASSEL HOSPITAL</head>

                        <p>Sir Ernest Cassel's travelling ophthalmic hospital, which has been
                            visiting the 1 Fayoum province, is to be transferred hence I to
                            Damietta. Dr. A. Ferguson MacCallan, who is the ophthalmist in charge of
                            the hospital, left this week for Cairo. His assistant, Tahir Effendi,
                            leaves with the tents and all the hospital paraphernalia next week.
                            During the stay of the hospital here no less than 12,402 visits have
                            been paid by patients. Of these 637 were operated on for trichiosis,
                            irridoctomy, cataract, and other ophthalmic complaints so common in this
                            country. I used to visit Dr. MacCallan as a confrere, and I can state
                            from my own experience that his success in the treatment of soft and
                            senile cataract was most remarkable, and during his stay here he has
                            alleviated a very large amount of suffering among the people. In the
                            name of the inhabitants of the Fayoum I beg to thank Sir Ernest Cassel
                            and the skilful physician in charge of his hospital, for the good that
                            has been done in this province by the hospital. </p>
                        <p>The following passages from Dr. MacCallan's interesting report on his
                            last year's work are worth quoting:— </p>
                        <p>“At the inception of the scheme, there was some doubt as to its probable
                            success, and as to the readiness of the fellaheen to take advantage of
                            it. All doubt has, however, been, set at rest by its immediate and
                            complete success. There has never been the smallest hesitation on the
                            part of the people to visit the hospital as patients, nor to submit
                            themselves to whatever operation I have advised. The large proportion of
                            women patients has been especially noteworthy. Both at Menonf and
                            Damietta, the number of would-be patients has been much larger than the
                            surgical staff of the hospital could cope with. It was no uncommon thing
                            to find in the morning 200 people anxious to obtain admission, and the
                            same condition of affaire now obtains at Galionb." </p>
                        <p>"All patients are treated free of charge, and are given bottles of drops
                            and lotions for use at home when necessary. By far the larger proportion
                            of the patients who attend the hospital have every appearance of
                            poverty, and if there are more patients on any day than can be seen, the
                            poorer patients are given preference. </p>
                        <p>Dr. MacCallan concludes his report with the following words :— </p>
                        <p>“The extension of the travelling ophthalmic hospital scheme throughout
                            the country would, I feel certain; be as successful from an economic as
                            from a philanthropic point of view. The number of inefficient workers
                            due to the ravages of trachoma is enormous, and every child who now
                            obtains relief at the camps is a worker saved from the ban of
                            inefficiency." </p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer remarks as follows on this report:— </p>
                        <p>“One of the results of the absence of means of ophthalmic relief in the
                            rural districts is the multiplication of quacks, who often do more harm
                            than good to their patients. The establishment of the travelling
                            hospitals will in some degree mitigate this evil, but the remedy so far
                            applied has necessarily been only very partial. It is a well-known fact
                            which is confirmed by Dr. Mac Callan, that a large proportion of the
                            children who attend the Government schools require skilled medical
                            treatment for their eyes." </p>
                        <p>And in regard to Dr. MacCallan’s conclusion his lordship says:— </p>
                        <p>"I do not doubt that Dr. MacCallan is quite right. In view of the very
                            large number of subjects which call for the attention of the Government
                            in this country, and of the further fact that the resources of the State
                            do not admit of all these subjects being treated at the same time and
                            immediately, I am always somewhat unwilling to state beforehand when it
                            will be possible to take in hand any particular project for reform. I
                            have, however, no hesitation in expresing a strong hope that before long
                            it will be possible for the Government to provide means for extending
                            the excellent system which, under Sir Ernest Cassel’s auspices has now
                            been inaugurated.” </p>

                    <head>REPORT FOR 1904.</head>

                    <p>In reviewing the Medical Mission work of the past twelve, months, we, cannot
                        but feel that 1904 has been a year of advance. A comparison of the
                        statistics of the two last years shows marked progress in numbers. For
                        instance, in 1903 we were glad to record 19,730 as the total number of
                        outpatient visits to our Dispensary. Last year the number rose to 25,057.
                        Again, the number of patients has risen from 864 to 1,767, while our total
                        receipts in fees, etc. have been nearly doubled, thus enabling us to defray
                        all expenses, save missionary allowances, and to end the year with a
                        substantial balance.</p>

                    <p>With regard to spiritual results, which man cannot estimate, one can say that
                        there have been evidences of a deepened spirit of enquiry and more earnest
                        interest. Tangible spiritual results are few indeed, and were these our only
                        guarantee of success, and were it not for the knowledge that results are in
                        higher hands, it would be truly hard, having put one’s hand to the plough,
                        not to look back. </p>
                    <p>Manifest tokens of God’s blearing, however, are not wanting. Some weeks ago
                        we had a Sudanese, woman in hospital who was admitted for the treatment of a
                        rare form of malignant growth on the foot. Sad to say, the disease has
                        recurred repeatedly elsewhere, and will sooner or later almost certainly
                        lead to a fatal issue. The patient was under Dr. Pains' care and I will
                        quote his account of her:—</p>

                    <p>"She came here because, as she put it, she had seen, in a dream, someone come
                        and say to her: Go to the English Hospital in Old Cairo. Very soon after
                        admission she showed great interest in the Gospel story, and expressed
                        herself as certain that the one she had seen in her dream was Christ
                        Himself. She has been daily taught and learns rapidly with the full
                        intention of being baptised, after she has put her affairs in order. She has
                        some land she wants to sell, in order that it, as is most likely after
                        baptism, she is cast out by her people, she may have wherewith to live. She
                        quite recognises the probability of persecution, but says she will say to
                        her son: “‘We have been on the wrong road. Christ has found me and put me on
                        the right one. Will you come with me along it? Even if you won't, I must
                        keep on it’”</p>

                    <p>Another encouraging case is that of a printer, a Cairo man, who had
                        previously worked for our Mission, and had been influenced by contact with
                        the missionaries and through the subject matter he had been employed to
                        print. Strangely enough he also, while in hospital, dreamed that he saw
                        Christ, who touched his hand and told him that he would soon recover. On
                        waking, he aroused the other Moslems in the ward and warned them against
                        opposing the Gospel, relating to them his vision. He was much impressed by
                        the teaching he received, and the last report I heard of him was to the
                        effect that he was doing all in his power to serve the Mission, in the face
                        of considerable difficulties. He himself told me not many days ago that he
                        was persuading some of the Moslems who work in the same press to attend the
                        C.M.S evangelistic meetings in Cairo.</p>

                    <p>There are other cases too which might be mentioned. One is that of a Moslem
                        woman who is now working as a dresser in hospital; another a patient on the
                        men's side who was with us many months. For a time he showed real
                        earnestness and it was thought well to give hint some private instruction
                        over and above the teaching he received in hospital. Later, however, we were
                        led to suspect that his keenness in learning was prompted by ulterior
                        motives. However that may have been, I have recently heard from the
                        catechist who visited his village that he is still taking an interest in the
                        Gospel, and the Bible which was given to him when he left us is being read
                        in his house. </p>
                    <p>While one writes one is reminded of a man who attended the dispensary for
                        some time. I well remember him as rather noisy opponent of the truth, and on
                        one occasion had to interfere on behalf of the catechist, who was the object
                        of his attacks. There are few now who are more kindly disposed towards the
                        mission than this man. He professes to believe in Christ and I believe his
                        professions are genuine. May he in due time be given grace to confess them
                        before men.</p>

                    <p>Other concrete examples of encouragement one might quote, but perhaps one of
                        the most cheering signs in the work is the deep interest with which the
                        Gospel message is received. There are always some in one’s audiences who
                        seem to drink in the story of salvation, and one feels that the seed is
                        falling on good ground. The fruit may be long in coming, but it is in the
                        hands of Him who alone can give the increase.</p>

                    <p>Early in the year (1904) a temporary ward to accommodate thirteen men was
                        built in the hospital compound, at a cost of about £70, which was derived
                        from the balance of a sum given some years ago by Cairo residents for the
                        erection of dormitories for Egyptian anemia patients. The ward has proved of
                        the greatest benefit and has enabled us to get the greatest possible amount
                        of use out of each bed in the hospital; as soon as a patient ia
                        admitted,—supposing it is a surgical case— he takes up his abod: in the
                        temporary ward until the day fixed for his operation. He is then transferred
                        to one of the beds in the hospital proper; but as soon as be recovers from
                        his operation sufficiently to enable him to get about a little, he returns
                        once more to the so called "Noah's Ark”. There he stops until he is allowed
                        to go home. So the hospital bed during the past months have been changing
                        occupants very quickly; and supporters of beds and cots can be assured that
                        their subscript XXXX are thus put to good account. (To be continued).</p>

                    <p>London May 19.</p>

                    <p>General Lord Grenfell G.C.B., G.C.M.G., who is already a Colonel Commandant
                        of the King's Royal Ride Corps (the 60th), has been selected for the
                        colonelcy of 2nd Life Guards, rendered vacant by the death of General Lord
                        Chelmsford, G.C.B., G.C.V.O By virtue of this appointment, Lord Grenfell
                        will become one of the three “Gold Sticks,” who take turns to be “in
                        waiting” on the King.</p>

                    <p>The whole of Lord Grenfell's regimental service was passed in the 60th, which
                        he joined as an ensign in 1859. He has held many staff appointments,
                        including that of Commander- in-Chief in Ireland, to which he was appointed
                        just a year ago ; and his war services include Griqualand West, in 1875 ;
                        the Zulu War, 1879 ; the Boer War, 1881; Egypt, 1882; Nile, 1884-5 ; and
                        Sudan, 1885-6-8-9. He has been seven times mentioned in despatches, and has
                        received many honors and rewards for his services.</p>

                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel W M. Duckett, A.P.D., has been formally appointed District
                        Pay master in Egypt, where he has been serving for some time.</p>

                    <p>When the Indian mail last left the 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps had
                        moved from Bareilly to Ranikhet. Lieutenant Colonel Walpole S. Kays,
                        commanding that battalion, has been promoted brevet-colonel He has worn the
                        “green-jacket” for over a quarter of a century and has the Ashanti
                        Expedition of 1895 to his credit (star).</p>

                    <p>Lieutenant Charles Howard, Royal Berkshire Regiment, who recently figured in
                        a case of alleged assault on the police in Dublin, has been removed from the
                        army for absence without leave. It is understood that he went to Canada
                        before his trial came off.</p>

                    <p>As soon as the first class cruiser "Carnarvon” is ready for commission she
                        will proceed to the Mediterranean Station to replace the "King Alfred" which
                        has taken the place of the "Aboukir" pro. tem. Captain Sir George J. S.
                        Warrender, Bart, brother-in law of the Earl of Shaftesbury, has been
                        appointed to the command of the “Carnarvon.” The "Carnarvon” is a cruiser of
                        the "County" class.</p>

                    <p>The 9.2 gun, several of which were recently sent out to our coaling stations
                        in the Far East, is a very fine weapon of long range and ballistic energy.
                        It weighs 25 tons unmounted and throws a projectile of 380 lbs weight. This
                        combined shot and shell is propelled to its destination by a charge of 63
                        lbs of cordite, which gives it a muzzle energy of 2,347 feet per second and
                        an effective range of eight miles. At 3,000 yards the “nine point two" can
                        perforate 18 inches of wrought iron. Half a dozen men can work it.</p>

                    <p>The projected manoeuvres of the Eastern Fleet—the East Indies, China and
                        Australian Squadrons—have been cancelled and properly so. With
                        Rodjestvensky's Pacific Squadron knocking about in the Far Eastern sees
                        there would be every chance of another “regrettable incident," in which the
                        gallant Russian gunners would hardly come off so well as they did in their
                        historic encounter with the Dogger Bank Trawling Fleet and the phantom
                        torpedo boats. There are some very straight shooting ships of ours in those
                        waters.</p>

                    <p>A good deal of fun is still being poked at the Army Council on account of the
                        minute regulations it issues on very trifling subjects. The fault lies in
                        the publicity given to them in the Press, for many are matters of such minor
                        detail that they need not go beyond the subordinates to whom they are
                        addressed. Only that restless desire to comment on the action of the
                        military authorities can explain why all the world should be told that nails
                        must be extricated from worn-out mop heads before they are retained into
                        store, or that the time-honored expression "By order” should no longer be
                        appended to the instructions given out in the name of officers commanding by
                        their staff. The energies of the military members of Council are perhaps
                        running to waste for want of freer outlet. According to current reports the
                        business of the War Office is greatly hampered and impeded just now by too
                        disinclination of the supreme chief to give definite decisions on questions
                        pending. So much uncertainty prevails as to the larger measures of
                        reconstruction still in abeyance that small matters of very necessary
                        routine are often neglected inconveniently.</p>

                    <p>If the public were not, at this time or day. ase-hardened to the exploits of
                        the British War Office, there would be a tremendous explosion of national
                        indignation over the official statement of the amount of stores and supplies
                        "destroyed locally” in South Africa between 1899 and 1901. Not only does the
                        loss in money amount to £293,937, but the loss is borne entirely by the
                        public. Not a single firm of contractors is a penny the worse for all this
                        fearful waste, and as to more than one-third of the total value, the War
                        Office calmly declares that it does not know whence the goods came. Besides
                        that proportion, there are other stone as to which the date of the supply
                        “cannot now be ascertained." Why, in the name of common-sense, cannot the
                        date be ascertained, and, therewith, the name of every firm that ever
                        supplied a single cartridge or a tin of preserved meat? Such a confession as
                        this is enough to make the most invincible optimist despair of any effectual
                        improvement of War Office methods. To our mind it is simply inconceivable
                        that the necessary information "cannot be ascertained;” but, if that be
                        really the case, somebody else, besides the public, ought to be made to
                        suffer for it.</p>

                    <head>GERMAN INTEREST IN EGYPT.</head>

                    <p>(From The “Berlin Post.”)</p>

                    <p>Business circles in Germany are beginning to direct their attention to Egypt
                        more than ever. There is no doubt that during the last 20 years that country
                        has made great strides. German imports from Egypt have risen from 13 million
                        marks in 1894 to 57 million marks in 1903. while the exports from Germany to
                        Egypt have risen from 7 to 23 million marks. It is not generally known that
                        Egypt exports enormous quantities of raw cotton to Germany. In 1903 alone
                        this amounted to 48 million marks. The increase of German traffic through
                        the Suez Canal, on the one hand, and the high price of English coal on the
                        other, have caused German shipowners to establish a coal depot at Port Said
                        which has been a great success, and has considerably increased the
                        importation of German coal into Egypt test year, 63 million tons were
                        exported to Egypt, most of which was consigned to this depot Seventy German
                        ships, of 150,000 tons, trade between this country and Alexandria, the chief
                        port of Egypt test year the Norddeutecher Lloyd ran a regular service
                        between Marseilles, Naples, and Alexandria, thus affording excellent
                        communica- between Europe and Egypt. The great increase of passengers by
                        this line has abundantly proved its necessity and justified its existence. A
                        German bank, a branch of the Orient Bank established at Athens, is about to
                        be opened in Alexandria, and the Hamburg-Amerika Line has arranged to start
                        a service of six river boats on the Nile carrying both passengers and
                        freight. All these arrangements prove, firstly, the existence of great
                        German commercial interests, and, secondly, these new departures show that
                        Egypt is a country of great possibilities, meriting more attention than it
                        has hitherto received. In consequence of this new service it will be
                        possible to open new German goods depots, and to form new commercial
                        centres. This undertaking will be supported by the already large foreign
                        trade, and the German concerns in Syria and Egypt will be able to lend each
                        other a helping hand and give mutual support. And there are yet other
                        opportunities for peaceful commercial enterprise.</p>

                    <head>THE SECRET OF THE WORLDS.</head>

                    <p>When we see what we have done and what we are on the point of doing, writes
                        Manrice Maeterlinck in the "New York Tribune," it is not absurd to hope that
                        some day we shall lay hold of that essential secret of the worlds which for
                        the time being we have called the law of gravitation.</p>

                    <p>There is nothing mad in supposing that the secret of this sovereign force
                        lies hidden within us, or around us, within reach of our hand.</p>

                    <p>It is perhaps tractable and docile even as light and electricity. It is
                        perhaps wholly spiritual, and depends upon a very simple cause which the
                        displacing of an object may reveal to us. The discovery of an unexpected
                        property of matter analogous to that which has just disclosed to us the
                        disconcerting qualities of radium may lead us straight to the very sources
                        of the energy and the life of the stars, and from that moment man's lot

                    <head>DOAN'S DINNER PILLS CURE EVERY LIVER, STOMACH &amp; BOWEL TROUBLE.</head>

                    <p>The greatest danger the General on the battle-field has to face, is the
                        cutting-off of food supplies: it means the starvation of his troops, and
                        ultimate disaster. In just the same way, your greatest danger is the failure
                        of the liver and stomach to change your food into nourishment for the blood,
                        bones and tissue.</p>

                    <p>This is why liver and stomach trouble is so serious ; it means that no matter
                        how much you eat, you are being slowly starved ; every nerve and organ is
                        being robbed of its' proper nourishment; the blood is poor and lacking in
                        redness, the lips and cheeks become pale, the eyes yellow, the expression
                        haggard. You grow thin and weak, feel heavy and list less. These symptoms
                        are the digestive organs' cry for help, and Doan’s dinner pills should be
                        used regularly until every sign of the trouble has gone, otherwise you will
                        be in danger of anemia, constipation, chronic indigestion, biliousness,
                        dyspepsia, and congestion of the liver. Doan's dinner pills are made from
                        pure roots and herbs that help the liver, stomach and bowels, restoring a
                        natural action and a healthy digestion of food. This medicine ought to be in
                        every, home, and a does at once by any one who is unwell.</p>

                    <p>Doan's Dinner Pills are for sale by all chemists and druggists at P.T. 5 a
                        box; or they may be had direct from the general agent for Egypt,—Max
                        Fischer, Hotel du Nil Street, Monsky, Cairo.</p>

                    <p>ITCHING SKIN DISEASES. - The first application of Doan's Ointment will
                        relieve Eczema, itching piles, ringworm, and any itching skin complaint,
                        while one pot is sufficient to cure the worst case. Doan's Ointment soothes
                        and heals the pores of the skin; it does not dry up too quickly, nor
                        irritate the skin. It is pure and clean. The price of Doan's Ointment is
                        P.T. 13 per pot, or P.T. 71 for 6 pots. To be had of all chemists, or direct

                    <p>“As I laye a thinkynge" Ingoldsby</p>

                    <p>While there is much in the recent address of Sir Frederick Treves on “the
                        physical effects of the use of alcohol" that may well be taken to heart and
                        acted upon, I cannot help thinking that in some passages he rather overshot
                        the mark, and made statements that he would find it very difficult to
                        substantiate.</p>

                    <p>Take for example, the following assertion: "The great and laudable ambition
                        of all, and especially of young man, to be 'it’ could not possibly be
                        achieved if they took alcohol. It was simply preposterous to suppose that
                        any young healthy person needed any alcohol whatever ; and, indeed, he was
                        much better without the smallest amount of it"</p>

                    <p>It needs no elaborate research to find examples in the lives of eminent men
                        that completely disprove this assertion, and justify the term reckless being
                        applied to it. Two very prominent instances of men in every sense fit and
                        capable strike me at once, Mr. Gladstone and the Earl of Shaftesbury, the
                        one the most distinguished statesman of the 19th century, the other a man of
                        equal prominence as a philanthropist .</p>

                    <p>Neither of those men were total abstainers. Neither must be judged merely by
                        the physical results on their bodies of taking alcohol but as public men by
                        the effect of their example upon those within the sphere of their influence,
                        especially that of the latter, whose life-work lay among the poor and
                        illiterate classes of London.</p>

                    <p>A few, years ago I made a careful study of Lord Shaftesbury's life, mainly
                        for the purpose of trying to determine in my own mind the following
                        question:— Great as the good achieved by his lordship undoubtedly was, would
                        it have been still further increased if he had been an advocate of total
                        abstinence from intoxicating liquors</p>

                    <p>The conclusion I formed was that instead of doing more good he would have
                        done less, because he would have to a very great extent imposed limits upon
                        himself, and raised up what would have in very many cases proved an
                        impassable barrier between himself and the people he did so much to
                        benefit.</p>

                    <p>No one would, I should imagine, seriously contend that, Mr. Gladstone in any
                        way dimmed the brilliance of his marvellous intellect by taking a glass of
                        wine with his dinner, or in the least degree lowered his high moral
                        character because he was a strictly moderate drinker.</p>

                    <p>Another thing that impressed me in this address by Sir F. Treves was that it
                        was limited to the effect that alcohol has on the system. One would almost
                        fancy from it that alcohol pun and simple was imbibed and that it was taken
                        without admixture with such other ingredients as malt and hops in ale, or
                        grape juice in a glass of wine. The sense of proportion is entirely lost
                        sight of, and it is simply classed with such well-known poisons as arsenic,
                        opium, or strychnia. Is this fair? I think not.</p>

                    <p>In taking this line, however, the speaker simply followed that usually
                        followed by propagandists, and it seems almost out of the question to expect
                        fair and impartial treatment at their hands, of any subject of which they
                        have undertaken the advocacy. It is always best to bear this in mind when
                        estimating the value of the assertions made from various platforms—and
                        pulpits.</p>

                    <p>But there are exceptions to every rule, and one of the most notable of these
                        came under my notice in London a few years ago. An eminent Christian
                        preacher, when referring to some of the sayings of Christ that are somewhat
                        hard to understand, “turning the other cheek," “giving the cloke also," and
                        so on, expressed his opinion that Jesus only did what other propagandists
                        did, viz, overstated his subject.</p>

                    <p>This was a somewhat bold step on the preacher's part, but it is an extremely
                        significant fact that advanced religious teachers are not afraid to grapple
                        with difficulties, and look for reasonable solutions of them, rather than
                        take shelter behind walls so many deem impregnable, (and which popular
                        prejudice helps to make so), when the voice of reason makes itself heard in
                        the attack on traditional belief.</p>

                    <p>So if the good people who devote themselves to philanthropic effort for the
                        good of man- kind do overstep the mark, they do so in good company, and if
                        Sir F. Treves did present a somewhat one-sided view of a great question
                        there is every reason to hope that he may have effected a great deal of
                        good, by bringing so prominently forward the value of temperance, and the
                        fact that the consumption of alcoholic drinks is enormously in excess of
                        what it should be.</p>

                    <p>The vegetarians, in my opinion, have a still stronger cue than the total
                        abstainers, for in addition to the undoubtedly injurious effects of an
                        excess of animal food, and the possibly ill effects (in some cases) of even
                        a moderate consumption of flesh food, there is the hideous amount of
                        suffering indicted on animals prior to their being killed, to be considered,
                        apart entirely from the question of taking animal life to provide food for
                        man.</p>

                    <p>The latter considerations carry far greater weight with me than the former. I
                        have seen so much preventive cruelty, and road of so much more, that I feel
                        persuaded that if the public in general were only better informed, and gave
                        more thought to the terrible sufferings borne by the animals which furnish
                        the meat-eater's daily food, the ranks of the vegetarians would be greatly
                        swelled.</p>

                    <p>But the question of personal health is no trivial one, and when it is fully
                        realised, as analysis amply proves, that far more nutriment may be obtained
                        from vegetable than from animal sources, the much greater freedom from
                        disease that the abstainer from flesh food enjoys as compared with his
                        meat-eating fellow man will be better appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Many would-be vegetarians are under the impression that it is impossible to
                        obtain the nourishment they require without eating animal food. They give
                        the vegetarian system a trial, but from an imperfect understanding of the
                        kind of food they should eat, and the proper proportion of heat, flesh,
                        brain; bone and nerve forming foods, — in other words the want of a
                        sufficiently scientific experiment,—they rash to the conclusion that the new
                        system is unsuited to their requirements.</p>

                    <p>Those who have perserved and endeavoured to understand the conditions
                        necessary to success, tell a different tale, and speak only of the benefit
                        gained by the change they have made; but still it must ever be borne in mind
                        that constitutions like everything else greatly differ, and that what is
                        meat to one man is poison to another.</p>

                    <p>It is this great central fact that propagandists are so prone to ignore. They
                        rash to the conclusion that what benefits one must be good for another, and
                        although they are instrumental in effecting great good, they are too apt to
                        lose sight of the great diversity of requirements to be found among “all
                        sorts and conditions of men," — bodily, mental and spiritual.</p>

                    <p>To the man or woman seeking spiritual unfoldment, and who, in order to attain
                        this end, is prepared to “mortify the lasts of the body," no better advice
                        can be given than to seek by pure diet and clean living to bring it about.
                        That it is possible to become at once, and without injurious bodily result a
                        total abstainer from flesh food, alcoholic drinks, and tobacco, after a
                        life-long indulgence in these habits up to beyond 50 years of age, I can,
                        from personal experience, testify, while nothing could be more marked than
                        the resultant quickening effects upon the mental and spiritual faculties. T.

                    <head>ORIENTAL STUDY IN ENGLAND.</head>

                    <p>The Council of the Royal Asiatic Society takes up a very strong position when
                        urging the necessity of bringing into active being a State institution for
                        the promotion of Oriental study, it is certainly not creditable to a country
                        ruling over more Asiatic subjects than all the other European and American
                        nations combined that such studies can be much better carried on at Berlin
                        or Paris. The report states that Anglo-Indian officers frequently take
                        furlough to one or the other of those capitals instead of going to London,
                        solely became the facilities for learning what they want to learn are so
                        highly superior. There would be no lack of competent teachers were the Royal
                        Asiatic Society's aspiration fulfilled ; we are amply supplied with
                        Orientalists of the highest attainments. But, as in many other matters,
                        England is satisfied with the arrangements which served well enough to keep
                        her in the front rank when foreign competition did not seem likely ever to
                        smirch her laurels. That being no longer the case, the Royal Asiatic Society
                        should not appeal in vain for the founding and endowment of a London centre
                        for Oriental study not inferior in learned competency to those at Paris and
                        Berlin. As it would be of great benefit to India, directly and indirectly,
                        the cost might be equally shared between the two Treasuries. Both spend
                        freely enough on objects not nearly so much wanted for the renown of the
                        greatest of Asiatic Powers.</p>

                    <head>SYRIAN TRADE.</head>

                    <p>Reporting from Aleppo, Mr. ConsUl Barnham says The year opened under
                        exceptionally favorable auspices. The rise in the price of cotton had
                        brought much money into the country. There was the prospect of a fall
                        harvest, with abundant pasture, and, consequently, a successful wool season.
                        During the first six months, indeed, these hopes were fully justified, trade
                        being unusually brisk, money plentiful and credit good. Then came a sudden
                        fall in the price of cotton, which completely changed the aspect of
                        things.</p>

                    <p>In Beyrout and Alexandretta important houses which had speculated in cotton
                        stopped payment, while in Aleppo, though there was only one failure, many of
                        the merchants were heavy losers through the failures which occurred
                        elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>The farmers also and nomad Arabs lost heavily owing to the spread of cattle
                        plague, and in a less degree from an outbreak of foot- and-mouth
                        disease.</p>

                    <p>The export trade through Alexandretta shows an increase of £239,573. The
                        import trade through Alexandretta shows a decrease of £264,321.</p>

                    <p>The importation of manufactured goods fell in volume 367 tons and in value
                        £294,450. This was due to the fail in the price of cotton and to the
                        existence of large stocks remaining over from the previous season. The
                        market is still suffering from this state of things, and dealers are often
                        compelled to dispose of their goods at wholesale prices. The imports of
                        Manchester cotton goods declined 377 tons in volume and £219,378 in value.
                        Other countries, however, show a similar decrease, notably Italy.</p>

                    <p>Three British lines—the Khedivial, Bell’s Asia Minor and Prince Line— have
                        carried on a regular service during the year. The Khedivial Company is, I
                        understand, about to establish another service connecting Constantinople
                        with the porta of Anatolia, Caramania, Syria and Egypt.</p>

                    <p>The exports being £1,376,207, show a decrease of £424,167. The imports amount
                        to £592,228, being a decrease of £37,222 on those of the previous year.</p>

                    <p>The exports to the United Kingdom and Cyprus have risen from £124,513 during
                        the year 1903 to £303,382 during 1904, showing thus an increase of £78,869.
                        There is a slight decrease amounting to £2,254 in the imports of the past
                        year from the United Kingdom and Cyprus, the figures being £93,137, as
                        against £95,381 for the year 1903. The general comparative conclusion is
                        decidedly favourable to the United Kingdom. Although, in common with other
                        nations, her share of the import trade has slightly decreased, the United
                        Kingdom has easily out-distanced other nations in the increase of her share
                        of the export trade.</p>

                    <p>THE CYCLADES.</p>

                    <p>In a report on the trade of the Cyclades for last year, Mr. Consul Cottrell
                        states that the trade and commerce of Syria and the other islands of the
                        Cyclades in 1904 showed unmis takable signs of steady decline in comparison
                        with the preceding years, and the commercial depression still continues. The
                        volume of trade of tire port of Syra represented a total value of £363,255
                        against £375,138 in 1903 and £124,363 in 1902. It is feared no hopes can be
                        entertained of any substantial amelioration for the future, in view of the
                        industrial resources of the neighbouring port of the Piraeus, together with
                        the fact that the construction of railways in continental Greece is having a
                        deteriorating effect on Syra, which in former years was a large distributing
                        centre of commerce for nearly the whole of the Levant. Even the improvement
                        in the money market last year, resulting from the exceptional fall in
                        exchange, apparently engendered no stimulus in the purchasing powers of the
                        local traders, although the question of the depreciation of forced currency
                        has for many years greatly hampered the commercial dealings with foreign
                        countries. Business in shipping circles again suffered severely last year
                        from the persistence of few freights. As elsewhere, the available tonnage
                        was a long way in excess of the demand, and the Black Sea and Danube trade,
                        in which nearly all Greek steamers find employment, proved a disappointing
                        and unprofitable market. Several vessels were in consequence lying idle in
                        harbour for months at a stretch : even those that were engaged at current
                        freights, except perhaps the few on time charter, barely recovered their
                        working expenses, notwithstanding that Greek ships are run more economically
                        than those under any other flag afloat. The Black Sea freights to
                        Mediterranean and northern ports averaged 6s and 8s. per ton respectively,
                        and outward freights from the United Kingdom, with coal only obtainable,
                        were as low as 4s. 6d. per ton. Tho prospects also for 1905 are not very
                        encouraging, and shipowners are becoming disheartened, after having invested
                        so much local capital on this in preference to any other industry.</p>

                    <p>GREEK TRADE</p>

                    <p>Reporting on the Greek province of Thessaly for 1904, Mr. Consul Merlin
                        says:-- There has been a small falling off in the number of British merchant
                        steamers which entered the port of Volo in the year 1904 as compared with
                        the preceding year, the total number being 33 vessels of 36,138 aggregate
                        net tons register, as against 25 vessels in 1903 of 39,615 tons register.
                        The vessels which arrived in the past year discharged 9,037 tons of cargo,
                        of the total estimated value of £39,191.</p>

                    <p>In 1903 14,965 tons of similar merchandise were discharged from British
                        bottoms of £46,839 total estimated value. Although the quantity and value of
                        cargo of British origin brought in British vessels in 1904 is less than in
                        the preceding year, the deficit is more apparent than real, as two foreign
                        steamships, one Austro-Hungarian and one Norwegian, came from Cardiff
                        bringing 6,450 tons of coal and patent fuel, valued at £6,200.</p>

                    <p>The trade in commodities of British origin in 1904 shows an increase over
                        that of the preceding year, and may therefore be regarded as satisfactory
                        under existing circumstances . It is true that the demand for articles of
                        foreign manufacture shows comparatively little fluctuation from year to
                        year, nor could it be reasonably expected to do otherwise, considering that
                        Thessaly is a strictly agricultural province, the development of which must
                        necessarily proceed slowly. All that can be expected under present
                        conditions is that the proportion of British products annually imported
                        should be maintained and show no falling-off.</p>

                    <p>Although in the aggregate a considerale trade is done in articles of British
                        manufacturers, no commission agent or trader of British nationality is at
                        present carrying on business in Thessaly, and the trade is therefore
                        entirely maintained owing to the high estimation of the quality of the
                        products which is very generally entertained throughout this district. I am
                        frequently told that when an article of first-rate quality is desired the
                        customer almost invariably insists that it shall be of British
                        manufacture.</p>

                    <p>The “Figaro'' publishes an account of an interview which one of its
                        correspondents at Canea has had with Prince George of Greece, who is
                        represented to have declared that the only means of putting an end to the
                        disturbed state of Crete is the union of the island with Greece. "The Prince
                        would like,” it is added, a plebiscite of the inhabitants of the island, to
                        be organised under the control of the Great Powers. He is convinced that a
                        plebiscite would show that the only way of satisfying the national
                        aspirations of the Cretan people is to grant them union with Greece.</p>

                        Bluffs, Iowa, writes:</p>

                    <p>"Peruna is no experimentsl medicine I have used it off and on now for three
                        years. At that time I was cured of irregular painful menstruation Since that
                        time I have taken it for indigestion or whenever I felt overworkedand in
                        need of a tonic, and I have always found that it was of great benefit to me.
                        I am therefore pleased and happy to say a word in its praise and shall glady
                        indorse it to my friends."-- Mrs. J. P. Coady</p>

                    <p>Miss Hattie Grace , 254 West 46th St., New York, writes:</p>

                    <p>"Peruna has changed me from a fretful, irritable, nervous woman into a
                        healthy and happy one. Nothing seems to worry and to fret me anymore Since
                        early womanhood I suffered with bearing down pains and and nervousness. I
                        was thin and worried, but Peruna restored me. Those who knew me before
                        cannot understand the change, but I can sum it all up in the blessed word,
                        Peruna"-- Hattie Grace</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Ferguson, No.181, 31st St., Brooklyn, N.Y., President West
                        Brooklyn Audubon Society, writes:</p>

                    <p>"I am pleased to tell what a blessing Peruna has been to me. Several years
                        ago my constitution seemed broken down and I cared little whether I lived or
                        died. I had taken so much medicine that the sight of a bottle made me sick.
                        I had read about Peruna curing women, and I though perhaps it would help me.
                        I bought a bottle and before it was finished I felt better. I kept on taking
                        it, and after three months' faithful use I was a well woman and able to do
                        the work and undergo the strain of younger days."-- Elizabeth Ferguson.</p>

                    <p>In view of the great multitude of women suffering from some form of female
                        disease and yet unable to find any cure, Dr. Hartman, the renowned
                        gynecologist has announced his willingness to direct the treatment of as
                        many cases as make application to him during the summer months without
                        charge.</p>

                    <p>The treatment will be conducted by correspondence. The doctor will prescribe
                        all medicines, applications, hyglenic and dietary regulations necessary to
                        complete a cure. The medicines prescribed can be obtained at all drug
                        stores. This offer will hold good only during the summer months. Any woman
                        can become a regular patient by sending a written statement of her age,
                        condition of life, history and symptoms of her derangements. </p>
                    <p>All cases of female diseases, including menstrual irregularities,
                        displacements, ulcerations, inflammations, discharges, irritation of the
                        ovaries, tumors and dropsy of the abdomen, should apply at once and become
                        registered as regular patients. All correspondence will be held strictly
                        confidential.</p>

                    <p>As is well known, Dr. Hartman is the president of the Hartman Sanitarium, an
                        institution which has a department devoted exclusively to the treatment of
                        female diseases. He is thus brought to see thousands of such cases every
                        year, the most of whom return to their homes to be treated by
                        correspondence. The principal remedy he relies upon in such cases is Peruna,
                        which every woman should have who has any affection of this kind. Those
                        wishing to become patients should address Dr. S. B. Hartman, Columbus,
                        Ohio.</p>

                    <p>No one knows better than Dr. Hartman how much the women suffer with diseases
                        peculiar to their sex. No one knows better than he does how many of them
                        suffer with such diseases. Patiently, hopefully, wearily; and often
                        silently, they eke ont a miserable existence, year after year.</p>

                    <p>No martyr in poetry or heroine in romance makes a more touching appeal to
                        human sympathy than the woman burdened with the cares of a family trying to
                        carry the extra load of some tormenting and ever present female disease.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Hartman's sympathy for such is unbounded, and his willingness to help
                        them limited only to his power.</p>

                    <p>For directions everyone should read "The Ills of Life", a copy of which
                        surrounds such bottle. Peruna is for sale by all chemists and druggists at
                        five shillings per bottle or six bottles for twenty five shillings.</p>

                    <p>Those wishing direct correspondence with Dr. Hartman and can wait the
                        necessary delay in receiving a reply should address Dr. S. B. HARTMAN,
                        Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A.</p>

                    <head>ITALY AND TRIPOLI.</head>

                    <p>(From Our Correspondent).</p>

                    <p>Rome, May 21.- Perhaps more than any other country Italy has periods of
                        excitement over certain things, and now for about four weeks the whole
                        attention has been absorbed by foreign politics, especially by the question
                        of Tripoli, with revelations of all kinds, interpellations in the Senate
                        interrogations in the Chamber, and discussions of the Foreign Budget; so
                        that of those who are not accustomed to the nature of the country it might
                        seem that the Peninsula is going to declare war on the whole world, while in
                        reality in a fortnight all will be over. The question of Tripoli is,
                        however, very interesting, as Italy, seeing herself threatened with being
                        surrounded in the Mediterranean, succeeded in agreeing with England and
                        France that the only part of North Africa still belonging to the Sultan
                        should be left to her influence. Still, the will not occupy Tripoli, not
                        desiring to imitate what Franco did with Algiers and Tunis, and England with
                        Egypt, for many reasons, chiefly because, especially after the war with
                        Abyssinia, there is in Italy a very strong party against colonial
                        enterprise, and because a war with Turkey, no matter how easy, would
                        represent the loss of several millions, which might upset that balance of
                        the Budget of which the Italians are so proud. Besides, Italy at present is
                        allied with Germany and Austria, has reestablished the most friendly
                        relations with France, continues to have with England the traditional bonds,
                        and will do nothing to come to a rupture with the recluse of Yildiz Kiosk.
                        Therefore, the descendants of Macchiavelli have thought of a very curious
                        policy, that of warning the other Powers that no one can go to Tripoli
                        except Italy, who, however, will not use force to occupy it, except in case
                        her preferential rights are threatened ; but wishes to establish herself
                        between Egypt and Tunis in accord with the present owner of that territory,
                        making Conntantinople understand that if the Turk fought he would lore
                        Tripoli and a lot of money and men ; while, by coming to an understanding,
                        he may preserve important privileges there, save all his men, and get a
                        large indemnity or a considerable yearly income.</p>
