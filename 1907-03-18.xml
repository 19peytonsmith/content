                    <head>A PARLIAMENT FOR EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>In an article under the above tite the "Spectator" remarks : We are convinced
                        that the present House of Commons, and the Liberal Party which controls it
                        by so huge majority, are sincerely anxious to do everything in their power
                        for the welfare of Egypt. They desire that the Egyptins should be well
                        governed, and should be free from those influences of tyranny and corruption
                        which unfortunately are almost always the fate of Eastern nations when left
                        to the control of native rulers. We have only to study the present condition
                        of Morocco, of Turkey, and of Persia, and to note the methods of government
                        there adopted, to realise what "Home-rule" means in the East. It means
                        oppression and cruelty and unbridled liccuse at the top, and misery and
                        degradation at the bottom. From these conditions the people of Egypt, whose
                        history during the past five or six hundred years has been one long tale of
                        servitude and shame, have lately been rescued by the wisdom and justice of
                        British rule. Our government in Egypt may not have beenn perfect - few human
                        institutions can claim that attribute - but at any rate it has raised the
                        position of the Egyptian peasent, and much of the poorer classes generally,
                        from one which is is no exaggeration to deseribe as the most unhappy on the
                        face of the earth to one of happiness and prosperity. When we went to Egypt
                        the population was not only taxed so heavily that the tax-collector left the
                        villager nothing but the barest subsidence allowance, but by means of a
                        system of forced labour he was reduced to a Condition bordering on
                        servitude. Now, after some twenty years of British control, there is no
                        other Mohamedan cultivator of the soil or inhabitant of a town who is in so
                        good a position. The taxes are collected justly, and Lhe poor man is now
                        able to rise through his own efforts to a level, not merely of comfort, but
                        of aflluence. He is no longer afraid to show his wealth lest the demands of
                        the taxpayer should be increased, and he is able to rely upon the government
                        to protect him from the arbitrary oppression of those who are richer than
                        himself or who hold an official poisition. We are now asked to destroy the
                        welfare that has been thus won. That, in plain English, is the meaning of
                        demand that Egypt shall be endowed with fu11 Parliamentary institutions, and
                        the Egyptians are allowed to govern themselves. The demand for such
                        institutions has been made by the Egyptian General Assembly; and since this
                        change cannot, for manny reasons, be carried out immediately it is suggested
                        that the British Government should at once confer with the existing
                        Legislative Council and upon, the General Assembly powers which would place
                        the complete control of the finances and of the administration of Egypt in
                        their hands. We are well aware that there is a little danger of the present
                        Government listening to any such proposals as those. There is, however, a
                        certain danger of well meaning persons here who value and rightly value,
                        Free Parliamentary institutions, being misled. Into thinking that they are
                        as applicable to the East as to the West. The "Spectator," after an analysis
                        of the influences which have been at work, asks what is the ordinary Briton
                        to do, and answers the question thus: in our opinion he has only one course
                        open to him. He must keep his eye solely on one object, and that object good
                        government for Egypt. As long as he provides such good government, he is
                        doing his duty to the uttermost, and, paradoxically as it may seem, he is
                        also fulfilling the ideal of the Egyptians. It is only through Western
                        control and Western sovereignty that the Oriental can really secure the
                        government. which he most desires,--the government of the sane and
                        beneficent despot tempered by public opinion. He cannot make sure of getting
                        it through an hereditary despot, because it is impossible to guarantee a
                        line of beneficent despots. He cannot, again, under modern conditions,
                        obtain. it by the old system of intermittent revolution. When, however, the
                        appointment and control of the reigning despot are vested in a
                        self-governing Western nation, he has his best security that the despot will
                        be a true trustee. We have provided Egypt with such a despot in Lord Cromer,
                        an autocrat who intensely desires the good of the country he governs, and
                        who is always willing and ready to be guided by the reasonable public
                        opinion of these over whom he rues. When Lord Cromer's rule comes to an end
                        we may be certain that the British democracy will make every effort to
                        secure a ruler who shall be capable of carrying on his trusteeship. In other
                        words, the British democracy can give, and if it does its duty wiII continue
                        to give, the Egyptian the form of government which suites him best, and
                        which, except only in name, he most desires. At heart, his only real
                        grievance against the kind of government we supply is that it is not quite
                        arbitrary and occasional enough, and acts somewhat too much on rigid
                        principles. We have only one more word to say, and that is to warn the
                        people of Egypt that the one thing which the British people will not consent
                        to is to share the ultimate responsibility of the government of Egypt with
                        them or anybody else. Either the British people must be responsible and must
                        say the final word, or else we must hand over to the Egyptians their
                        government out and out. The notion that we are by our Navy to protect their
                        coasts from foreign invasion, either by the Turks or some other European
                        Power, and also to organize their military forces in order to put down
                        internal revolts and to Protect them from fanatical incursions like those of
                        the Dervishes, while the Pasha class under some travesty of representative
                        institution, exploits the wealth of Egypt and pillages the small cultivator,
                        is one which must be made clear will never be tolerated in this country. We
                        have had in the past generation experience in native States in India of such
                        regimes, and they have always. Resulted in shame to us and misery to the
                        subject populations. The worst pages in our Indian history are that which
                        tell how the East India Company from motives of policy. kept bad and
                        inefficient native rulers on their thrones by the aid of British military
                        power. As we have said, either we must fully abandon Egypt to her fate, or
                        we must rule as trustees who are determined to secure the government of the
                        people, and to protect the peasant not only against the oppressions of those
                        above him, but from his own fatuity and infirmity of purpose. Such supreme
                        control is of course perfectly compatible, as we have already proved with
                        allowing a very large share in the administration of their country to native
                        Egyptians, and also with a wise and enlightened deference to the best
                        expressions of Egyptian public opinion. What it is not consistent with is
                        the establishment of any form of so-called Egyptian Parliamentary control.
                        To pretend otherwise is to run the risk of throwing Egypt back into the
                        misery, oppression, and corruption from which the British people saved her
                        through the instrumentality of Lord Cromer and the men who have worked under
                        him. We say the British people” advised, for, greatly as we admire lord
                        Cromer’s achievement, and acknowledge the value of his work, it is. In the
                        last resort to the political instincts and to the governing traditions of
                        the British people as a whole that we must give the credit of what has been
                        accomplished in Egypt. It because our people. and our parliament understand
                        the art of ruling Orien¬tal peoples, and of infusing into that rule the
                        essential principles of liberty, that we have succeeded in Egypt. We have
                        never for one moment attempted to exploit Egypt for our own benefit. On the
                        contrary we have kept before us, in spite of many temptations, the
                        fundamental rule that, we must govern Egypt as we govern India, --in the
                        interests of the governed. As long as we stick faithfully to that rule we
                        need have no fear of being overcome by any conscientious misgivings as to
                        our rights, and no fear also of our rule being swept away by those who we
                        govern. </p>

                        been ordered by Rome to open an enquiry and is now staying with the African
                        Monks at Shoubra. The Patriarch is charged with using the patriarchal funds
                        for speculation in real property and shares, and also with - applying to
                        his, clergy regulations which have not been submitted to the approbation of

                    <p>The rumour published recently by a local paper that the above company was
                        removing its head office in Cairo from the Sharia Bab-el Hadid, in which it
                        has been in talled for many years, to another part of the city, in
                        consequence of the sale of the land on which the offices stand by the
                        Princess, Nasle, is not quite correct The facts are that the company had
                        received a notice to: quit with an offer of a handsome indemnity as the
                        lease it holds has still seven years to run. Count de Serionne, the Suez
                        Canal representative in Cairo, thereupon purchased a property at
                        Kasr-el-Doubara, situated near Ghazi Mukhtar Pasha's palace, and consisting
                        of 1,300 square metres, en part of which is a large villa, now occupied by
                        Mr. Williamson, wherein to locate the offices Since then it was discovered
                        that the land at Bab-el Hadid, being Wakts property, cannot be disposed of
                        by the Princess without the consent of the Cadi, and this course is not
                        expected before May. Should the decision of the Cadi be unfavourable, then
                        the company will have to resell the villa at Kasr-el-Doubara and the offices
                        will remain where they are at present.</p>

                    <p>“The application for subscriptions to the capital of this company seemed more
                        or less formal, as the list was to be opened and closed in London, Cairo,
                        and Alexandria on one ılay only. The scheme contains several objectionable
                        features, one being the inclusion in the capital of deferred or founders'
                        shares entitled to 40 per cent of the profits The directors, who are als»
                        the holders of the founders' shares, are entitled to a percentage of the
                        profits, and, altogether, 80 much sifting is to take place that there seems
                        to be little temptation to subscribe for, or purchase, the ordinary
                        shares."</p>
                    <p>This criticism is not justified as Messrs. Arditi &amp; Co. are, it should be
                        borne in mind, giving up a valuable business and as a consideration for this
                        they took the greater part of the founders' shares. The "Economist" does not
                        appear to have been aware of this fact.</p>
                    <p>The "Economist" is also not justified in its remarks that as the list was
                        opened and closed in London, Cairo, and Alexandria in a single day the
                        applications for subscriptions seemed to be more or less formal. As the
                        issue was covered ten times over in that one day, it would be ridiculous to
                        complicate the difficulties of the allotment by extending the time, and the
                        promoters were therefore fully justified in only keeping it open for a
                        single day.</p>
                    <p> The "Statist" says: "It will readily be understood that the future of such a
                        company depends almost entirely upon management." </p>

                    <p> This telegram is a remarkable specimen of the ingenious methods which our
                        contemporary employs. In order to swell the numbers of the deputation a
                        single individual member of it is made to appear as three separate persons,
                        and Sir Brampton. Gurtau is put as "Sir Brampton, Hyphen, Gurdon," clearly

                    <p>COLLISION IN THE CANAL.</p>
                    <p> (FROM one CORRESPONDENT.) </p>
                    <p> Suez, Saturday. </p>
                    <p> A collision took place yesterday in the Canal, between the outward-bound
                        S.S. Horsley and the homeward-bound S.S. Alcinous, with the result that the
                        former was damaged above the western line. She was, however, moored in the
                        North Basin at Port. Ibrahim, and after being surveyed sailed to-day. The
                        hired troopship Plassy, from Bombay, bound to Southampton, arrived at Suez
                        and entered the Canal yesterday evening, The French steamer Africa, with
                        Algerian pilgrims, entered the Canal to day in quarantine. Mutinies among
                        the troops on board the Turkish transports have become very frequent of
                        late. The transport Hodeidah, which was lying at Suez with time expired men
                        from Hodeidah, entered : the Canal in quarantine yesterday morning, after
                        having had a mutiny on board, as the troops became impatient and wanted to
                        go through the canal. In many cases the troops are not blame, as they are
                        constantly ill-treated on board, and are very often short of rations..' </p>

                    <p> The well-known play "Galatea" was most successfully performed yesterday
                        evening at the Cercle International at Port Tewfik. Mr. Geo. Mavr » appeared
                        as Pygmileon, King of Cyprus, Mlle. Chrysů Mavro as Galatea, Mr. Costi
                        Antippa ag Rennos, , and Mr. Carydas as Euniilog. The performance was, in
                        aid of the Greek poor. The costumes were excellent. The club room was
                        crowded with representatives of all nationalities. Great credit is due to
                        the amateurs for the performance. </p>

                    <p> If the confetti fête at Shepheard's on Friday night was not such a success
                        as in former years the fault must be laid at the door of the Clerk of the
                        Weather, who had elected to celebrate the occasion with a belated snap of
                        cold weather. It was a cruel disappointment for many who had been looking
                        forward to this annual entertainment, and still more cruel for those who had
                        taken such infinite pains to make it a success. Never has that beautiful
                        Larden - been more delightfully decorated, - thousands of Chinese lanterns
                        hanging in festoons about its paths, the trees being heavy-laden with
                        illuminated globes, and the grass being starred with myriads of artificial
                        glow-worms ; while great arcs of colo red electric light lit up the paths
                        and flower beds with | strange and unexpected glow. A busy, traffic was done
                        at the Confetti stall ; the tentative onslaught of the earlier comers soon
                        growing into a fierce fusillade ; and the mimic paper snow, storm. waxed
                        thicker and ever thicker as the evening wore on, and in spite of thick
                        overcoats and veils: there were but few who did not show unmistakable signs
                        of the fray But though the fun was fast | and furious for the moment it was
                        over sooner than usual, and there was but little of the loitering in the
                        grounds that there would have been had the weather been more genial. The
                        crowd inside the hotel was enormous. Not a seat was to be bad. by
                        late-comers for dinner either in dining-ball, restaurant, or grill-room, and
                        the 800 invitations that had been issued to outsiders resulted in an
                        attendance which | can hardly be imagined: Dancing commenced in the Egyptian
                        Hall shortly before eleven ; | and though the programme was shorter than I
                        usual, it was well on in the morning before the hotel was left to its
                        well-earned repose. </p>

                    <p> SAINT SAENS FESTIVAL, </p>
                    <p> (FROM OUR THEATRICAL CORRESPONDENT. </p>
                    <p> The Saint-Saëns festival given at the Abbas Theatre in Wednesday was a great
                        success. The fine orchestra and excellent singers did full justice to the
                        great composer. M. Bracale allowed what conducting should be, and in the
                        "Marche Heroique” and still more so in the delightful "Rouet d'Omphale," he
                        made his orchestra do wonders of delicacy, and effect. The "Danse Macabre" –
                        a most weird and interesting piece—was also excellently given Mme Bracale
                        bas , a delightful voice, and her a admirable singing minimised our regret
                        at Mlle Devilloy's- absence. She shone especially in the air from "Åndrea
                        Chenier,” and as an encore gave us a most pleasing canzonetta. Mme Chaix
                        Bonheur showed her usual artistic mastery and intellect all through. The
                        "Melodies Persanes," especially the first, with its quaint almost northern
                        witchery, were fascinating not only for themselves but for the ease and
                        perfection of technique, with which they were presented. Again the greater
                        from "Samson et Dalila" was finally given : another critic says, Mme Chaix
                        Bonheur shows an exceptional comprehension of Saint-Saëns' music, but I
                        cannot admit what some say of her voice. Fine and flexible as it is, it is
                        cold, and almost constrained : if she were not so good a musician it would
                        be antipathetic. M. Escalais was not so sympathetic as usual, but he sang
                        with his accustomed mastery and knowledge. Naturally enough the encore to
                        the “Guillaume Tell” air was "Di Quella Pira," his “war-horse" and
                        relaxation ; but, commonplace as it is, che redeems it by his authority and
                        correct vigour. He is a really great singer and we shall be lucky if he is
                        re-engaged. In tije “Samson et Dalila" duet he would probably have been
                        better on the stage ; certainly the difference between him, and the worthy
                        Moisson’s colourless efforts is most marked. Altogether it was a most
                        attractive and successful concert I should not omit M. Valentino, who
                        accompanied. He is one of the best accompanists one can wish to hear, and he
                        contributed greatly to the success of the singing </p>

                    <head>MISS MAUD VALÉRIE WHITE'S RECITAL.</head>
                    <p> The Saint Saëns concert was followed, on Thursday night, by Miss Maud
                        Valérie White'a recital at the Khedivial Opera House. Some of her songs are
                        really interesting, notably "Ein Jüngling" and "Die Sonne Komnt," in both of
                        which she grasps the real spirit of the words in a most admirable aud
                        sympathetic manner. The rest were all good-far better than the usual
                        production of English composers ; but there is a certain self-satisfaction,
                        a tendency to repetition, which is annoying. (She has the impression that
                        she is content to miss what she might attain : her accompaniment of "Bois
                        Epais". heightened this. She seemed to be evading the sternness and self
                        sacrifice called for by that most perfect old music. In her bands it was
                        almost florid and modernized. Lady Valda Machell sang admirably throughout.
                        She has a most pleasing and perfectly trained võice, and a great sympathy
                        with and understanding of the music Mme Amster and Miss Reibold were quite
                        excellent, but less interesting to listen to. M. Lucenti was unable to sing.
                        His great voice would have been superb in that theatre. M. Molina, a
                        baritone from the Abbas Theatre, took his place, and sang with admirable
                        technique and feeling; but his voice lacks depth of tone and Strength. Mlle
                        Tschernerzka played a Tschaikowsky Romance, and the Erl Konis, this last so
                        well as to merit an encore, for which she give Rubinstein's Romance in E
                        flat. M Ridel Saillard's Bach allegro was rather an unfortunate choice. It
                        did not suit him, and the result was very tame and lifeless. The concert
                        ended with two piano pieces by Miss M. V. White herself The gavotte showed
                        much talent. On the whole it was interesting, and was appreciated by a large
                        and distinguished audience. Even if one cannot find all one hopes for in
                        Miss White's music, what one does hear is always sufficiently charming and
                        appropriate to distinguish her from almost every English song-writer They
                        are so often "hacks,” while she is certainly a musician. </p>

                    <p> The dance at the Savoy on Saturday, was in all probability the last - but

                        diminution in the numbers present ; and the return of the soldiers from
                        manoeuvres resulted in, many of the officers being present. Lord and Lady

                    <p> To The Editor of "THE "EGYPTİAN GAZETTE" </p>
                    <p> Sir, --The extracts, which you have published from the Anglophobe Arabic
                        Press on the subject of the recent resolution of the British Chamber of
                        Commerce in regard to the foolish proposals of the General Assembly, deserve
                        to be carefully considered by all who are interested in the commercial and
                        financial stability of this country. The committee meeting of the Chamber of
                        Commerce, which decided to memorialize the Home Government through the
                        medium of Lord Cromer, was well advised in taking this stèp. A few foolish'
                        notoriety hunters in the House of Commons appear to have been beguiled into
                        giving ear to the self advertising section, who would be only too eager to
                        weaken the Occupation in order that they might share in the spoliation of
                        the country. It is to be hoped that the eminently practical advice of the
                        British Chamber of Commerce will induce the supporters in England of this
                        discredited class of the native population to pause before things, go too
                        far, If Lord Cromer were to retire at a time such as the present there would
                        be a great crash and the increasing prosperity of the country would receive
                        a blow from which it might never recover. It was with a due sense of the
                        gravity of the crisis through, which Egypt is now passing that the Chamber
                        decided to pass the resolution on the General Assembly's iine of policy, and
                        I venture to state that * every other Chamber of Commerce in Egypt will
                        endorse the action taken by the British Chamber.--I am, etc., <name>A

                        Limited, because that company did not call up the remainder of its capital.
                        The board of directors are the best judges as to the right moment for
                        calling up the balarice of the capital, and if this company, can pay twenty
                        per cent on the capital that has been called up, why should it be under any,
                        obligation towards those speculative. persons who paid upp the whole simply

                    <p> En Ville. </p>
                    <p> Je viens de lire la lettre d’un actionnaire de l'Investment and Agency
                        (Abil) que vous avez publiée dans le No. de vendredi 15 courạnt dans votre
                        honorab'e journal. . Permettez moi d’ajouter deux mots aux très judicieuses
                        réflexions de votre correspondant.- Mes connaissances insuffisante. de
                        l’Anglais me forcent à employer le Français et j'ai bon espoir que vous
                        m'excuserez. </p>
                    <p> Il est 'notoire (indépendamment de toute critique sur la gestion des
                        affaires de l'Investment) que les actionnaires égyptiens se trouvent dans
                        une situation de flagrante infériorité par rapport à leurs collègues
                        porteurs des titres nominatifs Les trois quarts de leur capital placé en
                        Investment restent improductifs, morts ; et là où les porteurs des titres
                        nominatifs. touchent 20 %, les actions an porteur arrivent à grand, peine à
                        5% sur le nominal. C'est une ingénieuse fiction, on l'avouera, que celle qui
                        alloua, à l'Anglo Egyptian Bank pour un- durée de deux ans et plus une soume
                        très ronde de £ ..., absolument improductive pour l'Investment et qui
                        constitue pour les actionnaires Egyptiens une charge non seulement lourde
                        mais purement écrasante. Et cet état de choses semble. vouloir s'éterniser
                        pour le profit uniquement(?) de l’Auglo Egyptian Bank, société étrangère en
                        la matière </p>
                    <p> Or, les protestations platoniques - et les lettres et correspondances de
                        sont complètement--ne sont utiles qu'autant qu'elles sont suivies d'une
                        démarche plus pratique : Qu'un actionnaire de l'Investment prenne
                        l'initiative de provoquer une réunion d’actionnaires Egyptiene, à l'effet
                        d'exercer une pression auprès de qui de droit pour que les certificate émis
                        sur la signature de l'Anglo Egyptian Bank actuellement seuls négociables, en
                        Bourse et fictivement libérés en entier, soient remplacés par les titres
                        nominatifs en mains de l'Anglo, libérés pour 5/-. </p>
                    <p> D'ailleurs, il paraît que le système avait été imaginé pour faciliter les
                        transactions en Bourse et sur la demande d'un certain nombre d'agents de
                        change Cette même réunion pourrait dans ce cas s'adresser à l'Association
                        des Agents de change et obtenir que cet état de choses cessat. </p>
                    <p> Cette délicieuse et ruineuse facilité, par le fait même qu'elle dure depuis
                        deux ans et menace de ne jamais prendre firi, montre suffisamment que l'on a
                        surprie la bonne foi du public Egyptien, exploitable et, cory able à merci.
                        Le haut mandarinat de l'Investment n'a pas daigné jusqu'à ce jour donner des
                        explications et garde une attitude de, comment dire..; mauvais aloi. Ne
                        sont-ce pas li apparences de mauvaise aloi Et comment pourrions-nous juger

                    <p> MR. J.K.EVERSCHOYLE, C.M.G. </p>
                    <p> We regret to announce, the death, which took place at Cairo fast night, of
                        Mr. James Kynaston Edwards Verschoyle, C.M.G, Inspector-General of
                        Irrigation for Lower Egypt. Mr. Verschuyle had been suffering from pleurisy.
                        He was operated on a few days ago, but a subsequent relapse ended fatally.
                        Deceased was born in 1858 and received his education at 'Trinity College,
                        Dublin. In 1881 he went out to India as assistant engineer in the Public
                        Works Department and in 1894 was appointed executive engineer, retiring from
                        the service, in 1900. He was one of the many Anglo-Indian irrigation
                        specialists whose work in Egypt has made the Irrigation Department the basis
                        of all the wonderful material improvement of the past few years. Mr.
                        Verschoyle was one of the ablest officials in his department and his
                        appointment as Inspector General of Irrigation in Lower Egıpt was received
                        with universal acceptance. He was decorated with the 2nd olass Osmanien for
                        his services, and received the C.M.G. in 1902. </p>
                    <p> M. EUGENE LEBON. </p>
                    <p> The death is reported of M, Eugène Lebon, head of the Compagnie Centrale du
                        Gaz, which owns the gasworks and electrical stations at Cairo, Alexandria,
                        and Port Said. M. Lebon was one of the first pupils of the Ecole Centrale
                        des Arts et Manufactures (1847). For over half a century he administered in
                        a remarkably able manner 27 gasworks, lighting 60 towns of France, Spain,
                        Algeria, and Egypt, which are the property of the Compagnie Centrale, which
                        he made one of the first gas and electricity companies in Europe. M. Lebon
                        had or many years been an Officer of the Legion of Honour and Vice-President
                        of the Conseil Générale de Seine et Oise. </p>

                    <head> ITALIAN SCHOOLS IN CAIRO. </head>
                    <p> The large and imposing buildings which have been erected to house the four
                        schools belonging to the Italian Government in Cairo, and which were
                        commenced just one year ago, are now completed, at a cost of about £16,000.
                        The designs and plans were prepared by Mr. F. Parvis, engineer and architect
                        of Sharia El Madabegh, who was deputed by the authorities at Rome to submit
                        last year a detailed project with estimates, and the contractors were
                        Messrs. G. Garozzo and Figli, who built the schools at cost price. They
                        stand on 6,000 square metres of land bought from the Egyptian Government for
                        the purpose and are situated in the Boulac road, close to the Abou Eilela
                        Bridge, with the frontage on the new Abbas Boulevard which is being made
                        from Kasr-el-Nil to Abba-sieh This ground was sold at P.T 30 per square
                        metre, which was half the estimated value at the time of purchase by the
                        Italian consular authorities some two or three years ago, whereas now L.E.
                        20 is being asked for building sites on the opposite side of the Boulac
                        road. </p>
                    <p> The school premises have accommodation for the whole of the 1,000 pupils of
                        both sexes who formerly attended the four schools which were distributed in
                        different quarters of the city. One part of the building is set apart for a
                        commercial and technical branch, and the teaching staff is not confined to
                        Italian masters but includes also French and English professors. </p>
                    <p> The Italian Government, we are informed, allows a yearly subsidy of 200,000
                        francs, or £8,000, to the schools established in the principal towns of
                        Egypt, and gave a special grant besides towards erecting the new scholastic
                        establishment in Cairo, the remainder of the money having been found by the
                        richer members of the Italian community of the Capital. </p>
