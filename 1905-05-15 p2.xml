<div type="item">THE MODIFICATION OF THE
    luthor	CAPITULATIONS.
        <p>Propheoy is always dangeroas and its dangers
            slight are enormously accentuated in a country like
            ------, Egypt* whore international and religious jea-
            un. lonsies have only just begun to nod, and where
            ***}“*• the reformer and the prophet of reform must
            ' walk softly, unless they are anxious to awaken
            ts the very revise of a sleeping beauty. But
            while it is hopeless to attempt to describe in
            detail the legislation and the legislative
            machinery which, we hope, are destined to free
            Egypt from the inonbns of the Capitulations,
            the present situation and its nee's, the indica-
            tions furnished Lord Cromer’s Report, and the
            opinions expressed by European and Egyptian
            critics enable ns at least to give a negative
            forecast—partial and incomplete no doubt—
            but still a forecast We cannot pretend to
            foretell what will be the character of the new
            legislation,but we can ooDfidently predict what
            it will not be.
            So to our negative forecast: let us assume
            tbxt the Powers,in Lord Cromer’s words, "agvee
            to transfer to Croat Britain the legislative
            powers which they now collectively possess”
            and that this transfer of power would be
            followed by the creation "of some local machin-
            ery which would take a part in the enactment
            of laws applicable to Europeans.” In pursuance
            of our determination to avoid positive pro-
            phecy we will not waste time in speculations
            concerning the details of this machinery or
            the exact method of its creation. We confine
            ourselves to the statement, for which we can
            quote chapter and verse from the Report of
            H. B. M.’s Agent and Consul-General, that it
            will never be under international control, for the
            time has come for Egypt to create the machi-
            nery for general legislation which is possessed
            by 8tatea that have sparoely reached the stand-
            dard of civilisation that obtains in the lower
            valley and delta of the Nile. The Mixed
            Courts are an international institution in the
            striot sense of the term, and they are by their
            nature debarred from supplying Egypt with
            the legislative machinery that the oountry
            requires. Should their character change,
            should it beoome possible to free them from
            the political taint which oliugs to them
            through their constitution, should they
            become national and not international tri-
            bunals, it would then be possible to regard
            them as institutions the development of
            which would be of the utmost benefit
            to the country. But as matters stand they
            cannot be so regarded, in spite of the high
            degree of fairness and ability shown by so
            large a proportion of the magistrates of which
            they are and have been composed, and the
            natural desire which the British and Egyptian
            Governments would feel to avail themselves of
            their talents and experience.
            We are left with the British and Egyptian
            Governments as the sources of the legislative
            machinery of the future, but it does not in the
            least follow that the character of this
            machinery or of its produots will be pre-
            dominant'y British, any more than it will be
            predominantly Egyptian. In Section 3 of Lord
            Cromer’s Report we read “..........there can
            be no question of conferring oriminal juris-
            diction over Europeans on the Egyptian Law
            Courts as at present constituted. Europeans
            accused of a oriminal offence, or, at all events,
            of any serious oriminal offence, must be tried
            by Europeans.” Great Britain, as the pre-
            dominant Earopeaa Power in Egypt, and
            Egypt, as the interested party, will of course
            make their influence felt in the creation of
            tribunals for the trial of Europeans charged
            with oriminal offences, and in the drawing np
            of the Code by which they will be tried: bat
            no sane person would venture to suggest that
            the provisions of the Islamio law of inheritance
            should be made applioable to Europeans, and
            we feel ourselves justified in asserting that
            English oriminal law will not be employed by
            these tribunals. A Code is a sine qua non of
            the legislation of the future, and English
            oriminal law is unoodifiod: it follows that the
            Code must be more or less Latin in oharaoter,
            based on the Code NapoWon with such modi-
            fications as the local conditions demand. A Par-
            quet is a necessary consequence of the adop-
            tion of a Latin Code and the Parquet must be
            European. So muoh we safely infer, and we
            believe that we have good grounds for tho
            assumption that the legislative Authority ot
            the future, though not international, will yet
            be in a high degree oounopolitan. The judges
            of the new criminal courts cannot conceivably
            be chosen from one nation ouly, and there is
            no reason why the juriei in criminal oases
            should not be in some degree mixed, though a
            proportion of the juryman must be compatriots
            of the aoouBed. Bat we are venturing into the
            qnioksands of positive prophecy and mast
            hasten back to firfosr grouni We hope that
            we have convinced some at least of our readers
            that the new oriminal oourts will be free from
            the political interference of foreign Powers,
            and that Europeans will be tried by European
            magistrates under a European Criminal Code
            and Criminal Procedure Code.</p></div>
