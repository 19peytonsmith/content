                    <p>THE TABAH BLUE BOOK</p>
                    <p>For Anglo Egyptian* by far the most interesting sections of the Bine Book
                        dealing with the Turco Egyptian frontier dispute are Lord Cromer’s Note,
                        dated May 21, on the attitude of the Moslem population of Egypt towards
                        Great Britain in conception with the Frontier Question, and the remarkable
                        letter, apparently written by a Turkish ’alim, enclosed there- with. The
                        admirable translation of this document, which, we imagine, is the work of
                        Mr. H. Boyle, adds a literary charm to an extra- ordinarily interesting
                        expression of Pan-lslamio sentiment, and we commend this document to all who
                        are under the impression that religions motives have no part in the unrest
                        that has been remarked in Egypt during the last few months. </p>
                    <p>The Notes forwards 1 to Sir Edward Grey both by Sir Nicholas O’Conor and by
                        Lori Cromer are of great importance. Ы. В M.'s Ambassador at Constantinople,
                        in his Note of May 3, states that the Saltan, early in March, hid evinced a
                        remarkable suspicion of British designs on Akaba, which, from its proximity
                        to the Holy Places of 1 dam, is of great political л-id strategical
                        importance. Lord Cromer explains that this suspicion on the part of his
                        Imperial Maj »ty had its origin in the fictions industriously spread by the
                        Pan-lslamio Press of Cairo. </p>
                    <p>The attitude of the Turkish Commanders and of the Tarkish Government was
                        equally menacing. The Grand Vizier, telegraphing towards the end of January
                        to the Khedive, had remarked—inter a/ta—"that if Egypt persisted in landing
                        men and in constructing posts [This despatch was sent shortly after the
                        arrival of the Nonr elBahr at Tabah] snob an act of disobedieoce would
                        necessitate the employment of strong measures of ехраЫоп/’ The story of the
                        Diana's arrival off Akaba, the determined attitude of that fine type of
                        Tarkish soldier, Eashdi Pasha, the extraordinary behavior of the Tarkish
                        commissioners, and the defection of two Bedoain sheikhs, are all given, and
                        we note with some amazement that the date palm* at Tabah which were said to
                        belong to inhabitants of Akaba were only six or seven in number and were
                        "all dead." </p>
                    <p>The claims advanced by the Porte in April through the intermediary of Mukhtar
                        Pasba 1 converted the question from a purely local 1 dispute to a deliberate
                        attempt to oarry tbs Turkish borders to the Saez CanaL The unbending
                        attitude of the Ghati and the Turkish cooptation of Rafah brought matters to
                        a head, and the British Ultimatum of May 3 left to the Porte the decision
                        between peace and war. It is worth noting that while throughout the dispute
                        the attitude of the Porte had been I the reverse of conciliatory the
                        political development of the attack on Egypt had completely outrun the
                        Turkish military preparations. A raid was possible in the early days of May,
                        but its execution would have been attended with grave difficulties and its
                        failure would probably have involved the otter destruction of the raiders.
                        Mukhtar Pasha’s three Corps d’Armée were in no position to under- take an
                        immediate campaign against Egypt. </p>
                    <p>The attitude of the Great Powers daring the oourseof the dispute was
                        eminently satisfactory. Sir N. O’Conor particularly mentions the sup- m port
                        rendered by the French, Russian, Italian, and American Ambassadors, while,
                        whatever may be said of certain irresponsible German editors and "agents,”

                        the place comfortable arid a popular resort. The performance is of a varied

                    <p>THE UNSIGNED LETTER.</p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>One of the most interesting passages in the "Correspondence respecting the
                        Turco Egyptian Frontier in the Sinai Peninsula” is a letter addressed by
                        Lord Cromer to Sir Edward Grey in May last giving his opinion as to the
                        state of feeling existent in Egypt during the Turco- Egyptian crisis. It is
                        as follows :— </p>
                    <p>Cairo, May 21, 1906. </p>
                    <p>Sir,—On occasions when, as in the present instance of the Akaba frontier
                        question, a state of some tension exists between the Ottoman Government and
                        the European Powers, I never fail to receive a large number of letters
                        bearing on the subject, and written both by Egyptians and by Christians
                        residing in Egypt. These communications, which are sometimes signed, but
                        more frequently anonymous, usually contain little more than prayers from
                        Christians to be protected against Moslem violence, or menaces of a more or
                        less fierce nature from Moslems as to the consequences which will ensue from
                        the continuance of a policy hostile to His Imperial Majesty the Sultan. </p>
                    <p>These letters, from whichever side they emanate, are seldom deserving of much
                        consideration. They are generally inspired either by unreasonable fear or by
                        excited fanaticism. Some days ago, however', I received an unsigned letter
                        which, both on account of the nature of its cossets and the style of its
                        composition, appears to me to call for some degree of attention. I have the
                        honor to in close a translation herewith. </p>
                    <p>From the language of this document, and the signs of historical and literary
                        education which are found in it, I should judge it to be written by a member
                        of the Ulema class, not improbably of Turkish extraction. </p>
                    <p>You will observe that the writer, in very vigorous language, defines the
                        position of the Egyptian. People under the influence of two conflicting
                        sentiments - Damely, on the one hand, gratitude for material benefits
                        conferred by Christian reformers, and, on the other hand, that unquestioning
                        devotion which every true Moslem is taught, both by tradition and education,
                        that it is his duty and his privilege to render to the Khalif. </p>
                    <p>It will be seen that, in the opinion of the writer, there is no doubt as to
                        which of these sentiments carries, at least in a time of stresp, the greater
                        weight with the Moslem population. Expression is given, in brief but cordial
                        terms, to the feeling of gratitude which the Egyptians might be expected to
                        entertain for acknowledged benefits received ; no attempt is made to deny or
                        to depreciate the vaine of what Egypt h s gained from British advice and
                        assistance ; on the contrary, it is implied that, so long as nothing honors
                        to rouse Islamic feeling from its normally quiescent etate, the Egyptians
                        are prepared to receive with some degree of thankfulness, or at least
                        passively, the advantages which acorne to them from British and Christian
                        administration. </p>
                    <p>When, on the other hand, it is publicly thought and said that active
                        differences exist between the Christian Power and the re- presentative head
                        of the Moslem faith, the former must not for a moment be deluded by the hope
                        that the Moslem will betray his faith from motives of material gain. The
                        views set forth in this letter are, I believe, those which predominate in
                        the minds of a considerable number of Egyptian Moslems. </p>
                    <p>The frame of mind here indicated con- stitute?, I venture to think, an
                        important fdû tor in the Egyptian situation. From an historical point of
                        view, those unacquainted with the Oriental character might very pro- bably
                        find it a matter for surprise that the Turkish name, or the prospect of
                        reverting in any degree to a Turkish régime should inspire in Egypt any
                        sentiment bat that of fear. From the conquest of that country by the Sultan
                        Selim I. up to the time of Mehemet Ali Pasha, Turkish rule in Egypt was
                        characterized by oppressive cruelty, and by a complete disregard for the ini
                        e-ests of the people themselves. The country was relentlessly pluodered to
                        fill the Treasury at Constantinople, acd to enrioh the Valis aud subordinate
                        Ottoman officials who were named and removed in rapid succession by the Sub-
                        lime Porte. There seems to be little in this state of things wh;ch the
                        Egyptian can re- member with pleasure, or which he would desire to see
                        restored. </p>
                    <p>Moreover, the condition of the snrronnding Provinces of Syria and Arabia
                        should sntfice to prove to him that the methods of Government formerly
                        employed in his own country still remain in force elsewhere, and that no
                        change for the better has taken place in the system pursued ly a majority of
                        the Turkish ruling class. </p>
                    <p>It most, however, be remembered that nearly a century has elapsed since the
                        time when Egypt was ruled directly from Constantinople. None now living can
                        speak from personal experience of the system of government which prevailed
                        during that period; but few can remember to have heard an account of that
                        system from their fathers ; whilst noue who are less than from 30 to •iO
                        years old can speak from personal experience of the abuses which occurred
                        prior to the inauguration of the reforms und r taken on the accession of the
                        Khedive Tewfik. A generation is now growing up which has been born under
                        happier suspices and in и the enjoyment of a more enlightened
                        administration. The young men of this generation, who will soon constitute
                        the leading t c'ass in the country, are very prone tore- r gard these
                        traditions as pure inventions, or, g at least, as malicious exaggerations,
                        spread t abroad from interested motives. Under these circumstances, Turkish
                        rule appears to them c in a very false light. Closing their eyes to '
                        numerous object lessons around them, they 1 look only to the fact that they
                        are them- 1 selves a Moslem people, placed to some extent J under Christian
                        guidance which they would ' gladly see exchanged for the role of their 1
                        co-religion its, under the direct control of 1 the Head of their Faith. I do
                        not, of courses, ’ wish to be understood as implying that all, 1 or even a
                        majority of the Egyptians of the j young or older generations are inspired
                        by I this sentiment. But à strong leaven of it undoubtedly exists, and when
                        skillfully and ' eloquently put forward it can hardly fail to spread among
                        the mess of the people, whose i sympathies are a'.waye keenly alive to
                        appeals directed from this quarter. </p>
                    <p>I need hardly point out the disastrous results which would inevitably ensue
                        should these dreams ever be in any degree realized, or the bitter awakening
                        which would await those who had indulged in them. À return to Turkish
                        authority in this country in an active form could only mean ruin and
                        suffering to the great mass of the Egyptian people History repeats itself,
                        and those Egyptians who have studied the pages of the eloquent historian El
                        Jabarti may remember the enthusiasm with which the population welcomed the
                        army of the Grand Vizier Youssof Pasha when it entered Cairo on the
                        departure of the French, and how soon that enthusiasm was sobered under the
                        oppression and excesses of which they became the object. At the present day*
                        should such an untoward event take place, its effects would be cruelly felt
                        at once by every class, from the Khedive himself down to the humblest
                        cultivator. That Turkish soldiers and Turkish officials possess many fine
                        and admirable qualities is not disputed by any who know them well, but it
                        cannot be said that the power of administering a subject province with
                        justice and enlightenment is one of those qualities. </p>
                    <p>It may safely be asserted that in a short while nothing would remain of the
                        present structure which has been so laboriously raised. The wealth of the
                        country would be drained off by every form of extortionate taxation to
                        replenish the exhausted offers of the Imperial Treasury, justice would
                        become a thing of the past, and the mass of the population would learn by
                        hard experience that, instead of being, as at present, the object of the
                        keenest interest and solicitude to those in authority over them, they were
                        regarded merely as a subject race whose doty and privilege it was to toil
                        for the benefit of their masters. Even the upper classes, who might,
                        perhaps, expect to profit by the change in virtue of their influence and
                        position, would, I cannot doubt, share to a great extent the same fate.
                        There is little sympathy between the Ottoman Turk and the Turoo-Egyptian
                        Pasha, still less between the Turk and the rich fellah Notable. However well
                        the Egyptian aristocracy might be treated in the first stage of the new
                        order of things I am confident that in no long time they would find that
                        they had exchanged the position of free citizens under a well-ordered
                        government for that of subjects—in the fullest extent of the term—dependent
                        on the pleasure of a practically irresponsible autocracy. </p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>Nevertheless, in spite of there considerations, * which are too generally
                        overlooked or little 0 understood, the names of the Khalif and his 1
                        Imperial capital still po sear the power to ^ awaken enthusiasm in the minds
                        of many ® Egyptian Moslems. In so far as this sentiment 11 is founded upon
                        pure devotion to religious * faith and loyalty to the Head of that Faith, t
                        it cannot but excite some sympathy and b respect. Each is without doubt the
                        frame of i mind of the writer of the inclosed letter. But 1 as regards those
                        would-be leaders of Egyptian t thought who, without conviction and for their
                        s own purposes, endeavor under the guise of f religious zeal to inspire the
                        ignorant population ^ with a craving for Turkish rule, it is difficult I to
                        speak too severely of their conduit. 1 </p>
                    <p>It may confidently be said that there are many aspiration which may mors
                        worthily and advantageously ooonpy the attention of ‘ the Egyptians, and
                        towards the reasonable 1 attainment of which they may rely on the ‘ sympathy
                        and coopération of their European advisers. But it must be fully reoogm'zsd
                        that none of these aspirations could for a moment survive the accentuation
                        of Turkish domination 1 :n the country. At the present time much is being
                        said and written amongst tbe educated classe?, as to the development of
                        self-governing institutions. I have frequently alluded to 1 the subject in
                        my annual Reports. Here I need only say that, in process of time and with
                        increasing enlightenment, it may perhaps be found possible to take some
                        steps in this direction. But for the attainment of this end it is European
                        assistance and guidance, Dot Turkish rale, which are required. The first
                        result of any tightening of the Sultan’s hold over Egypt would undoubtedly
                        be the marked limitation and diminution of the authority of the Khedive. The
                        semi-independent position of the Khedives of E;ypt has never been viewed
                        with friendly eyes at Constantinople, and any opportunity of restricting and
                        oar- tailing this independence would be gladly welcomed by the Suzerain
                        Power. Under the conditions on which the Khedivate is now established, any
                        attempt of this nature one’d, of course, be easily frustrated. But I should
                        be happy to think that the Egyptians generally understood -as I am convinced
                        that many of them do understand —that the only means by which they can hope
                        to attain and to preserve that degree of administrative autonomy to which
                        they now aspire, is by utilizing to the fullest extent the advantages which
                        are now placed within their reach, and discouraging any iuaidious attempts
                        to draw closer the bond which connects Egypt with the remainder of the
                        Ottoman Empire. To this end all who dwell on Egyptian soil should, and I
                        trust will, work together in a community of interest ; the Egyptian, both
                        Moslem and Christian, and the European, who, whilst benefiting himself by
                        the development of the country, has done, and is doing, so much to improve
                        its resources and the material condition of its inhabitants. The real
                        utility to Egypt of this latter category wap, as is well known, for many
                        years partly paralyzed by the existence of feelings of mutual jealously and
                        mistrust, but these feelings seem happily to be now on the wane, a better
                        un- distending has been established, and I trust that a time may come when
                        the Christian and Moslem residents in Egypt, the subjects of the Siltan and
                        those of the Powers of Europe, will be cordially united in working for the
                        common cause—the moral and material prosperity of Egypt and its inhabitants.
                        But, I venture to repeat, the attainment of this object is not possible so
                        long as a willing ear is lent to those who endeavor to instill into the
                        minds of their countrymen a futile longing for the re-establishment of a
                        past system, which could only result in disappointment, and even disaster,
                        to all those who came under its influence. </p>

                    <p>The following is the text of the unsigned letter referred to above : — </p>
                    <p>In the name of God, &amp;c. </p>
                    <p>To Lord Cromer, His Britannic Majesty’s </p>

                    <p>(Translation.) </p>
                    <p>It is well known to you that the telegrams and newspapers appear each day,
                        bringing nearer to ns, as it seems, the likelihood of grave differences
                        between England and the Empire on matters relating to our land ot Egypt. But
                        as the hopes of men for things desired are often disappointed, so also—for
                        God is merciful to his creatures—Jo their fears of evil о mi to naught We
                        pray the Almighty that it may be so now. I who write these lines in the name
                        of "All the People of Egypt,” am not a statesman or a man of great name ; my
                        person and my dwelling are alike unknown to you, but I feel constrained,
                        inasmuoh as I see many foolish acts committed, and hear many foolish words
                        spoken, to stand on my feet and say the truth, as I think God has put it
                        into my heart. </p>
                    <p>It is often said by fool", or by those who think thereby to make favour with
                        the great, "The ourse of God upon the Christian”; “May hell consume the
                        unbeliever, his household and his possessions.” These are unbecoming words,
                        for corses pollute the lips of the corset, and the camel lies in wait for
                        the driver who mites him unjustly. At the head of this letter I call you by
                        the name of "The Reformer of Egypt," and by this name you are known between
                        the eeas and the deserts ; also many, but tot all, of the English who serve
                        you have followed in your footsteps as wise children carry on the traditions
                        of their father. He must be blind who sees not what the English have wrought
                        in Egypt : the gates of justice stand open to the poor; the streams flow
                        through the land are not stopped at the order of the strong ; the poor man
                        is lifted up and the rich man palled down ; the hand of the oppressor and
                        the briber is struck when outstretched to do evil. Our eyes see these
                        things, and we know from whom they come. You will say : "Be thankful, Oh,
                        men of Egypt! and bless those who benefit you”; and very many of us—those
                        who preserve a free mind and are not ruled by flattery and guile—are
                        thanking'. But thanks lie on the surface of the heart, and beneath is a deep
                        well. While peaoa is in the land the spirit of Islam Bleeps. We hear the
                        Imam ory out in the mosque against the unbelievers, bat his words pass by
                        like wind and are lost. Children hear them for the first time and do not
                        understand tlnm ; old men have heard them from childhood and pay no heed.
                        But it is said. "There is war between England and Abdul Hamid Khan.” If that
                        be so, a ohange must come. The words of the Imam are echoed in every heart,
                        and every Moslem hears only the ory of the Faith. As men we do not love the
                        sons of Osman ; the children at the breast know фей works, and that they
                        have trodden down the Egyptians like dry reeds. But as Modems they are our
                        brethren ; the Khalif holds the saored places aud the noble relios. Though
                        the Khalif were hapless as Bayezid, cruel as Murad, or mad as Ibrahim, he is
                        the shadow of Qod, and every Moslem must leap up at his call as the willing
                        servant to his master, though the wolf may devour his child while he does
                        his master’s work. The call of the Sultan is the oall of the Faith ; it
                        carries with it the command of the Prophet (blowing’s, &amp;c.). I and many
                        more trust that all may yet be peace ; but, if it be war, be sure that he
                        who has a sword will draw it, he who has a club will strike with it. The
                        women will ory from the house-tops, "God give victory to Islam !” You will
                        say, ‘ The Egyptian is more ungrateful than a dog, which remembers the hoard
                        that fed him. He is foolish as the madman who pulls down the roof tree of
                        his house upon himself.” It may be so to worldly eyes, but in the time of
                        danged • to Islam, the Moslem tarns away from the things of this world, and
                        thirsts only for the service of his Faith, even though be looks in the face
                        of death. May God (His Name be glorified) avert the evil ! </p>

                    <p>E. T. C. u. A MILITARY XI. OF R. D. F. </p>
                    <p>The military Xl.batted first and commenced
                        badly, losing 6 wickets for 18 runs. However,
                        some free hitting by Mr. French and Pte.
                        Evans improved matters ; despite this they
                        were all out for 99.
                    </p>
                    <p>The E. T. C. commenced almost as badly
                        as their opponents, losing 4 wkts. for 24, and
                        despite a rather late but good effort by Blyth-
                        mau, were all out for 75.
                    </p>
                    <p>On the military XI. going in a second time,
                        they were all out for 85, thanks to some good
                        bowling by Hanley and Henley, and good
                        fielding by all.
                    </p>
                    <p>This left the E.T.C. the sporting task of making 110 runs in exactly an hour.
                        They went for the runs and at 6.25 p.m. obtained them for the loss of four
                        wickets, chiefly doe to some fine hitting by Hanley and Steele. Scores :
