                    <head>THE ALGECIRAS CONFERENCE</head>
                    <p>A Havas telegram from Algeciras, which we publish to-day, announces that
                        Germany has refused to entertain the French proposal regarding the policing
                        of Morocoo by French and Spanish officers selcted by the Sultan.</p>

                    <!-- not sure if this should be considered column 4 or 6 -->
                    <p>Germany bases her non pouumus attitude on the fact that to permit such a
                        scheme would be oontrary to the internationalisation of the country and the
                        equality of the Powers there. As the conference may come to pieces on this
                        question it is important to consider it, especially in view of the new light
                        thrown on the subject by the statements which I appeared in the "Times" of
                        yesterday week. It will be remembered that a recent "inspired” communique to
                        the German Press gave it to be understood that France had claimed the right
                        to police the whole of Morocco, a claim against which Germany had protested,
                        and would protest, on the ground that it infringed the principle of the
                        Sultan’s independence, and would lead to the "Tunisification” of the She-
                        reefian Empire. Now as the Paris correspondent of the "Times” pointed out
                        yesterday week. M. Revoil has never made any each claim on behalf of h’s
                        Government—we shall see, present¬ly, why not. Ail that France claims is, as
                        M. Revoil has made it dear, the right to organise the policing of the ports,
                        and it is round the problem of organizing the necessary police force for the
                        seaports that the struggle is going on behind the screen of diplomatic
                        decency inter-posed by the formal meetings over which the Duke of Almodovar
                        presides.</p>
                    <p>Why is that particular problem the only one for which M. Revoil would have
                        been likely to claim, as he has done, the right of France to find the
                        necessary solution ? The answer is - simple enough. The penetration of the
                        civilising influence in Morocco must proceed, as the . anatomists say, from
                        without inwards. The fringe of Moroccan seaports formas the row of doors by
                        which Moroccao communicates (in so far as she is compelled to do so) with
                        Europe on the north and on the west These towns contain considerable
                        European populations engaged in trader or owning laud in the vicinity.
                        Outside the zone of the influence of these towns reigns immemorial chaos,
                        which extends over the rest of the land, right away to the Algerian frontier
                        on the east, and south¬wards to the sands of the Sahara. Can any sane person
                        imagine that France has any desire to attempt the subjugation—for that it
                        would have to be — manu military of an enormous country, absolutely
                        unprovided with roads, and inhabited by fierce, fighting tribesmen, who dare
                        not, if they could, grow more corn and other necessaries than they actually
                        want, for fear of the rapacity either of neighbours or of the local
                        governors in those of their districts where these feel themselves able to
                        practice extortion ? Years hence the interior of Morocco may gradually yield
                        to the process of more or less practise penetration; but for the present it
                        is enough to attempt to civilise the coasts—a proofs of which European
                        interests m the seaports have long been in sore need. Now, considering that
                        Germany's interests in Marocco have been officially declared to be purely
                        commercial, (though these amount to only about £90,000 worth of trade per
                        annum) one might have supposed that such interests would have been admirably
                        served by the prompt inauguration of a system which would guarantee the
                        security of life and property in and around the ports. But not a bit of it:
                        the German proposal, we are told, is that the Sultan shall do the work, with
                        the assistance of the minor powers. That would mean, of course, that there
                        would be no efficient organisation what¬ever. France, with her Algerian
                        experience, with her Algerian prestige, is the obvious agent to be selected
                        by Europe for the job; hot Germany, it seems, will not consent Wby? Because,
                        as as it would appear, she prefers the continuance of the present state of
                        things to a change which would put an everlasting veto upon the ambition
                        which she cherishes, but does not avow, of securing a foothold on the
                        Atlantic seaboard herself She knows that, for the present, that ambition
                        cannot be realised, bat she holds on to it, knowing that every¬thing comes
                        to those who know how to wait, and that, since she cannot get her own way
                        yet, the next best thing is to keep the door open, and bide her time until
                        circumstances, shall allow her to slip in. Those circumstances?, however,
                        will hardly be present just yet But the German game scarcely bodes well for
                        the success of the Morocco Conference.</p>
