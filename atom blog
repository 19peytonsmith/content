1906-01-22-p3 ACCIDENTAL SHOOTING AND FATALITY
The article that I found is from my Monday issue, 1906-01-22, and is in the middle of the third page.
 The topic is about and accidental shooting that occurred and a fatality that occurred.

The article states that a man shot himself with his own gun. How might someone do this you may ask yourself.
Well, the gun was on a table, and it fell off. When Mr. Sequino, the owner of the gun, went down to pick it up,
the trigger went off and he was shot in the mouth. Right in the bottom two teeth, which thankfully prevented his death. His gun, a revolver,
just so happened to go off without touching to the trigger. So, I did some research to see if a gun could falsely fire.
This website - https://www.kennerlyloutey.com/defective-remington-triggers-fire-still-not-recalled/ - provides information about guns that falsely fire even when they have the safety on.

Mr. Sequino survived this incident as I stated earlier, but he was in the hospital for some time. Being shot in the mouth required therapy,
and he has an issue with speaking properly because not only did the bullet knock out his bottom two front teeth, but it cut off a portion of his tongue.
This made it hard for him to communicate, and so I decided to research if therapy can help or if its useless.
The following website - https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/482402 - tells of speech therapy and how it actually helps someone who has lost teeth.
