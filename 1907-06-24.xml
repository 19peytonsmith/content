                    <p>ARABIC FOR “FLOWS THE WATER.”
                    Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil. Deliciously scented it 
                    cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can do, makes it pearly, white, gives life to 
                    the tissues, elasticity to the muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.
                    Its unique properties are due to Iollma Natural Water, so that it may well be called
                    Nature's Skin Food
                    and the skin requires nothing else to give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn,
                    heat, cold or the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to 
                    overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot eliminates are so fatal.
                    Invaluable for immediately curing mosquito and insect bites and for greatly preventing them.

                <head>COTTON INDUSTRY IN LANCASHIRE.</head>
                    <p>A change has come over the staple industry of Lancashire during the past few months. To-day 
                    things have come to such a pass in the weaving section that manufacturers are more disposed 
                    to stop a few weeks than to keep machinery fully employed. This state of things has been 
                    going on for a couple of months or so. All this year makers of piece goods who use bought 
                    yarn have been experiencing a narrower margin owing to the advancing tendency of yarn at a 
                    time when the supply of cop-twist and weft has been scarcely sufficient for the required 
                    consumption of the looms. Sellers of yarn have been enabled to obtain full quotations. Higher
                    raw cotton has meant higher yard prices, in short, spinners have kept their margin of profit 
                    pretty well, regardless of the narrowing margin of cloth producers.</p>
                    <p>The cloth demand from the great consuming market* of the East has fallen off, and orders have
                    only been obtainable in comparatively small lots at prices not in keeping with yarn values. 
                    The result of it all is that to-day the loom section dependable on bought yam is in a depressed
                    state, and in numerous cases it is felt that the best policy under the circumstances is to 
                    lessen the consumption of yarn by stopping and also decreasing the production of cloth and so 
                    relieve the market. At Whitsuntide this year, when the looms are usually idle for a few days, 
                    arrangements were made in Blackburn and other districts to extend the holidays several days.
                    This did not assist the market, no steps are being taken in Burnley, which is a big manufacturing
                    district, to close down a whole fortnight before the middle of next month. This is looked upon as
                    a drastic step, and it tells its own tale. There are 80,000 looms in that centre, and a fortnight’s
                    stoppage means a reduced consumption of yarn to the extent of nearly 8,000,OOO lb. It is estimated 
                    that it would take fifty spinning mills of average size, say 100,000 spindles, to produce this 
                    weight in a fortnight. The Accrington district, which has nearly 30,000 looms, is about to adopt
                    some such policy as has been agreed upon in Burnley. Other towns are following suit, such as Bacup.</p>
                    <p>Whilst all this short time is being worked in weaving, the spinning trade is folly employed on 
                    yarn contracts entered into some months ago. Spinners to-day have a good margin of profit in most 
                    counts and qualities, on every pound of yam they may sell. A feature is that the spinning holidays
                    are observed later on in the season. A matter of interest has been that the export demand for the 
                    Continent has strengthened the position of spinners lately.But for that Urge trade it is thought 
                    that spinners would have found their position by now less satisfactory than a month or two ago.
                    It almost seems from what is going on, that yarn has seen its best days. There is sure to be a 
                    material lessening of consumption, and on the other hand spinners are bringing more yam upon the 
                    market by the gradual starting of new milLs. Spinners have a more perfect organization than the 
                    weaving employers, and it remains to be seen what steps the Federation of spinning employers will 
                    take as to running lessened time in case the weaving short time becomes widespread. It would not
                    come as a surprise if the Federation, finding their margin slipping away, stopped the spindles for
                    a stated period. It is probable that there will be a struggle between the spindles and the looms 
                    during the next three or four months.</p>
                    <p>Trade generally, so far as the consumption of goods abroad is concerned, may be described as healthy. 
                    The higher prices will, no doubt, restrict operations, hut customers abroad are on the whole doing
                    very’ well, and the outlook in India is not at all unsatisfactory Fora couple of months past India 
                    has bought very little cloth. She possesses Urge supplies, but dealers in Bombay and Calcutta have
                    hesitated about following the higher course of values. Then she has awaited the monsoon rains. 
                    These rains which have been expected for a week past, set in at Bombay on Wednesday last, and if 
                    the downpour be general in the Dependency the crops will be assured, and business in piece goods
                    with Lancashire will probably be immediately resumed. China is over supplied, but the stocks there
                    are running down. Egypt and Turkey, as well as South America, take largely from us. Indeed, during 
                    the last few years they have increased their imports considerably.</p>
                    <p>All is uncertainty as to the probable American crop next season, which commences on Aug. 1st. In 
                    the meantime there is plenty of cotton to go round. If the American yield be as large as the last,
                    then all will be well for the County Palatine, but if it should prove to be a small crop, as two 
                    years ago, then there will not be enough raw material to keep the spindles of the world running 
                    full time.</p>

                    <p>The state of the Cairo streets often leaves much to be desired. Last week, while Mrs. Bailey,
                    a lady nurse, and Dr. Menasce were driving in the night along Sharia Abbas to an urgent case of 
                    hemorrage, their carriage drove into a mound of stones piled up in the middle of the road. The concussion
                    was so severe that the nurse was laid up owing to the shock. A correspondent writes :—“The Esbekieh 
                    Police Station was informed immediately after the accident by the doctor and Mrs. Bailey, but they never 
                    even took the trouble to go as far as the spot and see for themselves this neglect of the Tanzim. In fact

                    <p>The “Statist" in commenting on the crisis in Egypt, draws attention to the country’s great prosperity 
                    and remarks: “It is a natural result of all this (prosperity) that speculation should have become rampant, that
                    new companies should have been manufactured on a rash wale, and that many of the new companies should be bogus 
                    concerns. The banks, it is understood, have from the first set their faces against a large number of these new 
                    companies. Certain private bankers and private capitalists have financed them; but the great banks, Egyptian, 
                    British and French, have set their faces against them, and it is believed that they have of late been putting 
                    pressure upon their customers to take insail. The result is a further fall and some failures. It has been alleged 
                    that some of these failures will hit Paris severely. We believe this is a mistake so far as the banks are concerned, 
                    the banks as we have already said, having carefully refrained from financing all sorts of unsafe new companies. 
                    But it is possible, of course, that speculators in Paris may have been hit, and it is also possible that private 
                    capitalists may have been hit. However, so far as we can understand, the losses will fall chiefly upon operators in 
                    Egypt itself. The “Daily Telegraph," of the 18th inst., in reviewing the state of the London Stock Exchange for the week, says :—</p>
                    <p>“While only a couple of insignificant failures have taken place in the Stock Exchange this week, further heavy 
                    losses, it is to be feared, have been incurred by many brokers, owing to financial difficulties in Egypt, which have reacted
                    on London through Paris. For some time back trouble had been looked for, as the outcome of the land and bank speculation in 
                    Egypt, and its arrival should be no surprise. Apparently, however, two of the official agents de change in Paris have become 
                    involved with Alexandria clients, hence the recent selling of Rio Tinto, De Beers, and other securities." </p>
                    <p>“The Tribune" says :—</p>
                    <p>“The situation in Egypt naturally continues to be the subject of considerable discussion in financial circles. 
                    Cables received yesterday from that country intimated that the difficulties were confined to the bourse, and that further 
                    liquidation of speculative accounts was likely to take place. The commercial position, however, is said to be sound and the
                    value of agricultural land maintained, while a large cotton crop is looked for. The elimination of the weak speculative element 
                    will undoubtedly prove beneficial, and if the trouble does not extend to the commercial community an early recovery is not improbable.”</p>

                    <p>Several complaints have been made about the ice supply of Khartoum and its sister cities. The arbitrary regulations
                     adopted for its sale, making it impossible for a purchaser to buy less than a kilo, are commented upon but not regarded as
                     much of a serious grievance compared with the quality of the ice itself. It is made of unfiltered water, and contains much 
                     sand and other impurities—organic and inorganic. It taints the purity of the water or any other beverage with which it is 
                     used ; and is regarded as a menace to the public health. The suggestion is made that the ice manufacturing company might, 
                     without imperilling its financial stability, invest a few pounds in the purchase of zeers or filters or the installation of 
                     a filtering plant, and the cause of complaint will thereby be completely removed.</p>

                    <p>The general meeting of the Suez Canal shareholders adopted the report presented 
                     on behalf of the council of administration by Prince Auguste d’Arenberg.</p>
                    <p>Among the British members of the council of administration present at the meeting 
                     were the Hon. Reginald Lister, Sir Austin Lee, Mr. H.T. Anstruther, General Sir John Ardagh, 
                     Lord Rathmore, Sir T. Sutherland, and Messrs Green and Hughes. Mr. Donkin wrote regretting
                     his absence owing to illness. M. Lepine, Prefect of Police, who was appointed to the council
                     of administration, was presented to the shareholders.</p>
                    <p>Prince d’Arenberg, in addressing the meeting, surveyed the improvements introduced during 
                    the last ten years. He pointed out that since 1896 upwards of 36,000,000f.(£ 1,440,000) 
                    had been spent on widening and deepening the Suez Canal. The fine hospital of Port Said had
                    been enlarged, and dispensaries had been established in connexion with that hospital and at
                    Ismailia and at Port Tewfik, near Suez. At these institutions upwards of 120,000 patients 
                    had received treatment, and more than 500,000 consultations had been given. All those 
                    improvements bail been profitable, and the dividends, far from diminishing, had, on the 
                    contrary, increased. Alluding to the various rival canal schemes which periodically cropped
                    up, Prince d’Arenberg pointed out that the company enjoyed by treaty a monopoly canal 
                    exploitation in the isthmus, and that consequently companies desirous of embarking on a rival
                    enterprise would be obliged to go through the Jordan Valley, where they would encounter almost
                    insuperable difficulties.</p>
                    <p>A shareholder asked whether the council of administration was not afraid of the Panama 
                        Canal’s competing to a certain extent with the Suez Canal.</p>
                    <p>Prince d’Arenberg replied that very little American tonnage passed through the Suez 
                        Canal. Personally be believed that the Panama Canal would not affect the traffic of
                        the Suez Canal. The more new routes were opened to commerce the more would traffic be
                        increased and the more would the company profit.</p>
                    <p>On the motion of the council of administration the meeting unanimously ratified the 
                        appointment of the following new members of the council: — M. Lupine, Prefect of 
                        Police, in succession to the late M. Casimir Perier ; M. Denis Perouae, Inspector 
                        General of Roads and Bridges (retired), and formerly Director of Railways at the

                     especially if they happen to be engaged in warfare with a Christian power, and there
                     seems no reason for objecting to the very natural request for some substitute.

                    <p>The following was the chairmans speech at the meeting of the above company held on
                     Saturday afternoon:- </p>
                    <p>Gentlemen:</p>
                    <p>You will remember that at the General Meeting of the 16th April, confirmed by 
                     Meeting of the 7th May, both held in London, our Company was reconstituted on its 
                     original lines, and this is therefore the first Meeting held under these altered 
                     conditions though still an English Company you have no more London Board.</p>
                    <p>The accounts speak, I think, for themselves, and if any further information which 
                        is not contained in the report, and which I am in a position to give, is asked for,
                        I am here to reply.</p>
                    <p>As you are fully aware, as far as the property market and general financial situation
                        is concerned, Egypt is unfortunately under a cloud. Property sales are very rare and 
                        encashments of monies due on sales made are very difficult to obtain. A policy of 
                        waiting is absolutely imposed. This being the case, it may] he asked whether we have
                        been wise in paying out as dividend our entire amount of profit realized and on this
                        point I owe you an explanation.</p>
                    <p>When we come together next year, we shall have to divide our profits among a larger
                     state holding ; though there is no intention of any public issue of new capital, a 
                     convention has been entered into with Messrs. Suares Freres &amp; Cie whereby 10,000 s
                     hares (jouissance 1st April 1907) are to be allotted to them in exchange for their land 
                     at Meadi and L 75,000 cash ; and as we wish to be absolutely fair both to the new 
                     shareholders and the old, we judged it only right to disregard the temptation of keeping 
                     monies already earned, however useful they may be in the present crisis and to pay away 
                     to the old shareholders all the profits actually Encashed up to the 31st March, the more 
                     so as sales already effected will, if payments are made to us on due date, enable us to 
                     distribute a substantial dividend again next year.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, you all know the financial, crisis through which Egypt in common with every
                     other country in Europe and America is now going through. How long the crisis will last
                     nobody could tell; but be it short or be it long, the end is bound to come and we will
                     have a revival of confidence and active dealing in building lands. By this I do not
                     mean to say that I look forward in the immediate future to a recurrence of the very 
                     high prices that were paid for last year for some suburban properties: but cheap 
                     building lands such as your Company holds are bound to sell at prices that will 
                     yield handsome profits. A glance at our printed report will show you that we held on 
                     31st March 1907, 1,573,774 square metres of such lands costing a total sum of L E. 
                     179,061, which is equal to P.T. 11 1/2 per square metre or adding 40% for roads P.T. 
                     16 per square metre, amongst which area are included 60,000 square metres situated in 
                     various parts in the towns of Cairo, Tantah, etc., which even in these depressed times
                     can be sold at an average equal to a good many times that figure.</p>
                   <p>As to what has taken place since closing these accounts, the property of Snares Freres &amp; 
                     Cie adjoining ours at Meadi has been secured and we are already in possession. The property of 
                     Karkours has also been bought, but here we are not yet in possession, as the necessary 
                     formalities are not yet completed. These two purchases add another 730,000 square metres to
                     our domain at Meadi.</p>
                    <p>As to our negotiations with the Government re the road, I regret that these have not 
                     gone on as satisfactorily as we could wish. Up to the present, the Finance Committee having
                     only offered a sum of L.5,000 to improve the present Old Cairo road as far as Madabegh 
                     Station and this on condition that the Company provides at its own cost the site, and 
                     makes the remainder of the road, from Madabegh station onwards. The Public Works Department
                     themselves have assured us that the amount is entirely insufficient for the purpose, 
                     so that we can only hope for a wore generous and practicable response to a modified offer
                     we are now making to the Government. It is generally acknowledged that a road to Helouan
                     is absolutely essential and must be made sooner or later, and I am therefore sanguine 
                     that the Government will not miss profiting by this opportunity of obtaining over 4 
                     kilometres of this road made for nothing, as well as half the upkeep of a further large
                     section which this Company is rawly to guarantee. Negotiations for electrifying the 
                     Cairo-Helouan Railways are well advanced and when completed, our Meadi Estate will 
                     certainly be enhanced in value.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime we are building a few villa houses, which we hope to have ready 
                     towards the end of the year or early in 1908, and are also developing and improving your 
                     property.</p>
                    <p>I move “that the report of the directors dated 13th instant, together with statement
                     of accounts and balance sheet for the year ended 31st March 1907 be and they are hereby 
                     approved, confirmed and adopted.”</p>

                        possibly equally erroneous, but at any rate it is obvious that the deductions of our 
                        contemporary are absolutely ridiculous be the cause what it may.</p>
                    <p>Working upon the said basis the writer of the article, taking the bulletins from
                        May 25 to June 3, and from the 11th to the 17th June, finds that in the former 
                        period there were 487 births and 837 deaths, and in the latter period 462 births 
                        and 738 deaths. According to such figures the deaths in the Capital are at least
                        14,400 more than births, and, taking the census figures, viz 640,000, it only 
                        requires 44 years to leave Cairo without a single inhabitant.</p>

                    <head>BATHING AT CLEOPATRA.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Editor,—F. R. appears to be very indignant at the Jesuit Fathers’ 
                    conduct as regards “their notices and other impediments put up on the spot from 
                    using the pool” at Cleopatra. What strikes me most in the gentleman’s letter is 
                    not so much the cause of his grumbling, as the zeal wherewith he is animated to 
                    propagate by word and example his principles of Christian charity. His weapons are
                    inverted commas and black paint. Talk of St. Paul teaching the Athenians tho mysteries
                    of the unknown God, but F. R. preaching to the Jesuits beats anything of the sort. 
                    And supposing the good Fathers did listen to F. R., and took pattern by him; well, 
                    I fancy, they should have, in consequence, a very remarkable coating of his black
                    paint Sir, 1 know nothing about the Jesuits, or about Cleopatra and its pool, but
                    I am inclined to think, that it is not a white handkerchief that is working all the
                    mischief in the imagination of bathers. Perhaps, the pool can boast of a red rag, 
                    and we all know the effect produced in the mind of those who are pugnaciously inclined
                    by such a piece of stuff. Now F.R. get a wee bit hotter over the matter and the Jesuits
                    stall, in conscience, be obliged to give you a cooling in their pool ; and, furthermore,
                    try and make up your mind, ad Majorem Dei Gloriam, to get acquainted with these 
                    reverend gentlemen, for theirs is pre-eminently the art of raising one's charity 
                    above the freezing point and of inspiring people with tact and magnanimity. And don’t
                    be shy, please.</p>
                    <p>Yours truly,</p>

                    <p>The second meeting of the fifth season of the Alexandria Swimming Club was 
                    held on Saturday afternoon. The chief events of the meeting were a team race and 
                    polo match against H.M.S. “Diana.” The team race, which was 420 yards, each member
                    of the teams swimming 60 yards, was very well contested, but the club had got the 
                    better team together and won by a length and a half. After the team race was the 
                    polo match, which the club won by 6 goals to I, hut on this occasion a distinctly 
                    tatter match was witnessed, the “Diana" being much stronger than on the former 
                    occasion.The “Diana’s” goal keeper was especially prominent and saved several 
                    difficult shots ; indeed, he was responsible for reducing the score by not a few 
                    goals. The polo match was followed by a 60 yards handicap between the members of 
                    the Club, which brought out 14 competitors. The handicap was divided into two heats,
                    the winners of which were (I) Inglott and Liggins, and (2) Palmer and Darton. The 
                    final was won easily by Inglott who came in first by about five feet, hut only a 
                    touch separated second and third, who were Palmer and Liggins, respectively. The 
                    Club hope to hold a water carnival next Saturday in honour of the visit of the 
                    Mediterranean Fleet, which will arrive the previous day.</p>

                    <p>The object of Prince Aziz Pasha Hassan’s visit to Constantinople is to get
                    the permission of the Sultan to cruise among the Turkish islands in the Aegean Sea.
                    As soon as the permit is accorded, the Prince will return to Alexandria and start 
                    again on his yacht for a cruise.</p>
                    <p>Lord and Lady Cromer attended the memorial service, held by command of the
                    King in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace to the late Major-General Sir Arthur Ellis.</p>
                    <p>Lord and Lady Cromer also attended the State Bull at Buckingham Palace in honour
                    of the King and Queen of Denmark. Lady Cromer had a white gown with touches of silver
                    and a band of diamonds in her hair.</p>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, who embarked yesterday for Europe on the Austrian Lloyd 
                    mailboat, is replaced as Regent and Prime Minister by Boutros Pasha Ghali.</p>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Ibadi, who has postponed his visit to Europe in consequence of
                        the visit of the Mediterranean Fleet, will entertain the officers of the fleet
                        at the Alexandria Sporting Club on Saturday. On Friday evening they will be
                        given a banquet by Boutros Pasha Ghali, Regent and acting Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>Sir Ernest Cassel’s marble palace, Brook House, Park Lane, which he purchased from
                        Lord Tweedmouth, after undergoing extensive alterations, is reputed to be the finest
                        town house in London, and it is also said that there is not its equal either in Paris
                        or New York. The house is a veritable palace of marble, Italian and Canadian. The 
                        statuary, with which the reconstructed Brook House abounds, is representative of the
                        most famous masters. Everything in this luxurious Park-lane mansion is in accordance 
                        with the artistic taste of its owner and the architects, Messrs. White, Allom, &amp; Co.</p>
                    <p>The death is announced of Lord Granville Gordon, who died after leaving Suez on his 
                        way from Aden. He was heir presumptive to the Marquisate of Huntley and brother to the 
                        present Marquis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. William Jackson Maltass, of Alexandria, has composed a valse entitled “Happy 
                     Memoires,” which was played the other night for the Windsor Hotel and met with great
                     success. It is a very charming piece of composition and augurs well for the future 
                     career of this gentleman as a composer.</p>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel is leaving Alexandria on Wednesday next for Europe by the North
