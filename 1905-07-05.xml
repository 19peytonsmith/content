                    <head>THE INSURRECTION IN ARABIA.</head>
                    <p>The rising against Turkish authority in South-Western Arabia has hardly
                        attracted so much attention as it appears to be entitled to, alike from its
                        intrinsic interest and from its potential importance. For a period of now
                        something like four years intermittent hostilities have been in progress
                        between the local tribesmen and the Turkish garrisons, but for a long time
                        these amounted to nothing more than a series of desultory and indecisive
                        skirmishes. Quite recently, however, the aspect of affairs has undergone a
                        serious change. The troops of the Sultan are no longer able to hold their
                        own, and the City of Sana, the official and strategical capital of the
                        vilayet of Yemen, has fallen into the hands of the insurgents. This was not
                        the result of any sudden raid or unexpected attack, but was the direct
                        consequence of the defeat suffered by Marshal Riza Pasha and the six
                        thousand troops under his command in April last, when his Chief of the Staff
                        was killed and seven guns, together with a considerable quantity of rifles,
                        ammunition, and other stores, were captured by the victorious rebels.
                        Nothing effective has been done to remedy this reverse. Reports from
                        Constantinople speak, indeed, of two expeditionary columns for the recovery
                        of the town working round, one by way of Tais and the other from Menakha,
                        but there appears to be every reason for thinking that, just as in the
                        earlier part of the year when out of the eight battalions of the Janina
                        Brigade only two were found to be available, while the attempt to mobilise
                        the Albanian Redifs resulted in practical failure, so also at the present
                        moment there exists a substantial difficulty in bringing the ostensible
                        strengh of the Imperial forces to bear upon the hard facts of the situation.
                        The danger increases day by day. Only a few days ago it was announced that
                        the rebels were marching on Mecca, and there was nothing inherently
                        improbable in this, for having in effect secured the control of the more
                        populous of the two vilayets—the Yemen—it was only natural that they would
                        proceed to overflow into the Hedjaz. Mecca is, it is understood, not in a
                        condition to offer any real resistance, and its fall would be an event
                        fraught with the very gravest consequences, such as, indeed, no friend of
                        the Turkish Empire would contemplate with equanimity. Before the fall of
                        Sana the Vali of Uskub, General Shikir Pasha, was appointed president of a
                        commission to inquire into the Yemen situation with a view to the
                        introduction of administrative reforms, but the rebels declined to treat,
                        and the fact that the Imam Yahya Hamid-el-Din has struck a gold coinage and
                        assumed the title of Khalif is highly ominous. The Arabs of all Arabia may
                        have found the leader who has failed them for centuries, and should Arabia
                        break loose from the Ottoman Empire and Mecca be torn from the grasp of the
                        Sultan, the new situation will demand the utmost care and forethought on the
                        part of British diplomacy.</p>

                        The Fayoum province, which had hitherto remained free from the pest, has
                        been lightly attacked.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry further favors us with the following reports from the provinces

                    <p>Gharbieh :—3,086 feddans, belonging to 316 proprietors, have been attacked
                        and 2,119 have been cleared by 5,364 children.</p>

                        informed the committee that they placed at their disposal a plot of some
                        6,000 square metres which would be let to the club on a lease of 25 years at
                        the nominal rent of P.T. 1 per square metre, and that the Public Works
                        Department would undertake, free of cost, to level and enclose and otherwise
                        prepare the ground. The Government besides offered £400 as compensation in
                        view of the expense to be incurred in removing. The committee gladly
                        accepted these sums, as the ground offered in exchange is in a very suitable
                        position, being the corner plot on the Boulac-road, on the opposite side of
                        the bridge. As the preparatory work to be performed by the P.W.D. will take
                        quite a year to complete there seems every probability that the club will
                        remain where it is for that further period, if not longer. The cost of the
                        present premises, with tennis ground, &amp;c., was over £2,000, which was
                        raised by the issue of 2,500 shares of L.E. 1, of which P.T. 75 was paid up,
                        leaving P.T. 25 to be called up later.</p>
                    <p>We should not omit to mention that a similar notice to quit was sent at the
                        same time to the other three club, viz., the German, Swiss, and Thewfikieh
                        Tennis Club, who have been also offered other sites on the same terms and in
                        the same locality as those of the British Recreation Club, but no monetary
                        compensation, as the former dabs have been in existence for a much longer
                        period and are therefore considered to have been fully recompensed for any
                        expense incurred by the length of time granted them, which in one case is,
                        we are told, over 20 years, whilst the B. R. C. was only opened a little
                        over twelve months ago.</p>
                    <p>The British Recreation Club now numbers over 300 members, the chairman of the
                        committee being Dr. Madden and the honorary secretary Mr. J. Holme. The
                        annual subscription is P.T. 120, payable half-yearly in advance on the lst
                        April and 1st October.</p>

                        Khartoum and Uganda is far from being unheeded. The "C. M. Gleaner’’ for
                        July says : “Many have corresponded and made inquiries about it, and a fair
                        number have definitely offered. We are not yet, however, in a position to
                        announce who will have the honor of composing the first band, and we are
                        glad to record that one has been definitely appointed, and that he is a
                        member of the Society’s home staff. The Rev. F.B. Hadow, who came to the C.

                    <head>EGYPT INVESTMENTS: A WARNING.</head>
                    <p>The multiplication of land and other companies in Egypt during the past few
                        months (says the "African World”) may be a very excellent thing for the
                        promoters. Whether it is equally excellent for investors and for Egypt
                        remains to be seen. That the Nile land, with the vast irrigation schemes of
                        Sir William Garstin and his colleagues in process of gradual development,
                        offers a splendid field for the employment of capital, is undeniable, and
                        that much more capital than has yet been provided will be needed is
                        perfectly true. But these very facts, by reason of their obviousness and the
                        inducement they afford to the unsophisticated public to put up money for
                        anything Egyptian, are the main assets of the wild-cat company promoter, and
                        against him we wish to utter a warning. It would be a thousand pities if,
                        for lack of caution now on the part of prospective investors, Egypt,
                        notwithstanding its splendid prospects, got the bad name that clings so
                        tenaciously and so disastrously once it is obtained.</p>

                        Bedouins. The total number of lighters that were laden with rice was four,

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—In your paragraph of Monday, 3rd July, re “Esbekieh Gardens,”
                            the large attendances, and entire absence of police supervision, you
                            observe :—</p>
                        <p>“We should have thought it hardly necessary for the Press to have to
                            point out to the police authorities that wherever a crowd of some
                            thousands congregate there should be a number of policemen to maintain
                            order............................. ’’</p>
                        <p>It does seem comioally absurd that the newspaper Press should be called
                            upon to "point out” to the so-called police force of Cairo its manifest
                            and patent duty. It is unfortunate that the capital city of Africa
                            should be without police. I mean, of course, the city guards, who ought
                            to be available at all times, to exercise those functions which are the
                            A.B.C. of policemen’s duty, in all cities of the world, except
                            Cairo.</p>
                        <p>Cannot the pavements of the principal and most frequented thoroughfares,
                            including the Opera-square and the main streets radiating therefrom, be
                            kept free of troops of sheep and goats which perambulate there from
                            morning till night, forcing thousands of ladies from the sidewalks into
                            the roadways to save dainty draperies from the droppings of the animals
                            ? Could not the hours when sheep and goats go through the city be
                            regulated as in Europe É</p>
                        <p>Is it impossible, or quite possible, to devise means to prevent the
                            keepers and owners of restaurants and bars from monopolising not only
                            the pavements, but in many instances the roadways, and by filling them
                            with tables and chairs for their hundreds of customers’ convenience,
                            prevent thousands of pedestrians from using the footpaths, which the law
                            almost forces them to use ?</p>
                        <p>Not only these bar monopolists but the native camel men are equally
                            blameable in this respect. I saw a troop of loaded camels marching on
                            the pavement on the Esbekieh- gardens side at 6 o’clock in the evening
                            last week and frightened ladies jumping off it in front of the trams and
                            vehicles. The policeman on (presumedly) point duty, was deeply engaged
                            in astronomical studies at the time, and did not see the camels, but it
                            struck me that a constable who was not an amateur astronomer was
                            essential in this busiest of thoroughfares.</p>
                        <p>Is it quite impossible to regulate the movements, and above all insist
                            upon the quieter conduct, of the thousands of native watchmen in the
                            better class residential streets, who, having slept all day, bring their
                            benches to the pavements at night, and congregating in groups from
                            neighbouring houses, howl and scream all night, in argumentative strife
                            over subjects of no earthly interest, even to themselves ? Their one
                            success is in keeping tired people awake and indignant. Could not these
                            be prevented from using the streets for their nightly meeting and be
                            restricted to their owners’ gardens ?</p>
                        <p>Is it not practicable to formulate and give effect to regulations
                            providing for the use of footpaths for pedestrians and roads for wheeled
                            and analogous traffic ? At present the roadways are used, in common with
                            vehicles, by chiefly the native population, and no attempts are made to
                            keep them for vehicles. The result is that a cabdrive is a painful and
                            headaching experience, as the drivers are incessantly engaged in
                            shouting warnings to foot passengers, to other cab drivers, who will not
                            keep their proper side, and particularly to native drivers of heavy
                            carts, who sprawl all over the road heedless of everyone. If London
                            traffic can be efficiently regulated with its population of six
                            millions, why not Cairo with six hundred thousand ?</p>
                        <p>The remedy in the hands of the authorities is a simple one. Import a
                            London City Inspector of Police. Arm him with wide but carefully
                            regulated powers, and Cairo will become the well-ordered city it at
                            present it not. The police, as they are, seem to be a fairly civil and
                            reasonably plastic body, but they want some teaching, and this is,
                            apparently, entirely absent.</p>

                        <p>Sir,—Two days ago a fine horse was run over at Ibrahimieh. The
                            unfortunate animal had the oft hind leg all but severed at the thickest
                            part, but instead of being left near the scene of the accident until the
                            police could send and shoot it, I saw it being urged along on three legs
                            by a nondetscript crowd headed by a policeman, over the hill at
                            Ibrahimieh to Hadra police station. On being remonstrated with, the
                            policeman said he could not get a cart to convey it. This treatment, one
                            would think, was cruel enough, but I hear since, on reaching Hadra this
                            victim of civilisation was denied its right to a merciful bullet,
                            because forsooth ! — the exigencies of "red tape” required that it
                            should be taken on to Rosetta Gate. By the time it had been dragged as
                            far as Hadra I am told that the bone had come right through the skin,
                            and one can imagine the agony needlessly inflicted during the long tramp
                            through the mid-day heat.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that on such an occasion the police might be allowed on
                            their own responsibility to take a more humane course. Alexandria is
                            reputed an enlightened town and even has its S.P.C.A.--I am, etc.,</p>
