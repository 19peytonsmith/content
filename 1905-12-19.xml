                            made a declaration,” writes the Athens correspondent of the "Frank-

                            recently founded Barque d’Orient on the oreation of the Dew Deutsche
                            Ori*ntbank. The Greek National Bank,’ says Here von Streit, 'only
                            concurred in the foundation of the Btcqne d’Orient in order to pnt an
                            end to the entire interruption of business relations with Germany that

                            itself side by side with the bank of a powerful nation in Turkey.’
                            Perfect equality in business relations was established between the two

                            announced yesterday, oaused a great sensa- tion. The timely assistanoe
                            of the allied banks, however, has completely restored oonfidenoe. After
                            a short but sharp panic, prices are dosing near Saturday’s level. Jnited
                            Copper broke twenty points, but rallied afterwards. AU John Walsh's
                            enter- prises have been taken over by the allied banks.</p>

                            and the manner in wbioh the several stalls had been laid out was quite
                            artistic.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, Lady Cromer wee unable to * attend, and her abaseoe was
                            greatly felt, but drs. Bollock very kindly consented to open the sale.
                            The oeremony commenced with a short prayer by the Very Rev Dean Butoher,
                            ).D., who also made an excellent speech in * which, after expressing the
                            general regret alt at the absence of Lady Cromer and the gratitude of
                            the oommittee to Mrs. Bullook for filling the gap thus oaused, he gave a

                            Crookshauk ’*»ha and oarried with aoolamation, the stalls c were

                        <p>The principal stalls were the English stall, consisting ohiefly of

                            Botcher, and the Hon. Mrs. Davey ; the i lootoh stall, with woollen
                            goods, presided over by Lady Rogers, Lady Willoooka, Mm. Graham, and
                            Mrs. L’Eetrange Johnstone; the Irish stall, with li^en goods, presided .
                            over by Mrs. Johnson Pasha, Mrs. Milward. and Mrs. Trevithiok ; the
                            American stall, with 1 cakes and sweets, presided over by Mm Crookshank
                            Pasha and Mrs. Btoct ; aed the Continental stall, presided over by Mrs.
                            looker and Mme. Fabrioius Pasha. Besides the*e there were the Connaught
                            House stall, eavily laden with London goods, end a ohil- . drop’s stall
                            on whioh toys, dolls, and books abounded, and the tee-room, when refresh
                            ; rnenta were served at a moderate prioa, was well-patronised.</p>
                        <p>Want of space prevents os describing the various stalls and their burdens
                            in detail, but eaoh reflected great oredit on those who were responsible
                            for their arrangement, and what is more important, each was well
                            patronised, and at the dose of the evening their bnrdens were
                            considerably lighter. Should the second day prove as sncoessfal as
                            yesterday the organising oommittee will be able to con- gratnlate
                            themselves on the ample manner in whioh their efforts have been repaid.
                            We should imagine, however, that snoceu, such as is their due, is
                            already assured, for, although ' we have no idea of yesterday’s takings,
                            they must be considerable if all those who were present did their duty.

                        <p>In an article under the heading of 1 "Developments in the Sudan,” the
                            City editor cf the "Standard” says: With the opening of the Sudan
                            Railway shortly by Lord Cromer, a most important step will have been
                            taken in the direction of developing the resonroee of the
                            Sudanandinorsasing the oommeroialimportance of Khartonm. Only a few
                            years ago the oost and abonr of oonveyanoe between Egypt and the la dan
                            was heavy and wearisome, the Nile route having to be followed, with the
                            alter- native of the no less arduous though some- what shorter journey
                            by oamel from Snakin, vift Berber, while, even in recent times, the jour
                            ey from Cairo to Khartonm has taken something like foor days, with
                            almost daily transfers from one kind of oonveyanoe to another. Now,
                            however, the mode of transit will be comparatively rapid and simple, and
                            some id— of the shortening of the distanoe may be gathered from the faot
                            that after the open- ing of the new railway, Kh\rtonm will he within
                            eight days’ journey of London. With these improved facilities there will
                            naturally be a groat redaction in the freight ohaiges, and it is felt
                            that a considerable and important impetus it about to be given to trade
                            and to business with the Sndan. The whole of the oountry is extremely
                            fertile, and, with that attention that the Government of the Sndan
                            intends to devots to irrigation, the prospects ahead appear te be meet
                            promising, and al- ready have had a considerable influence upon the
                            value of land round about Khartonm, prices of bnilding sit— in the city
                            within the past six months having risen anything between 100 and 500 par
                            cent 1 n view of the recant over specula- tion in Egyptian land, it may
                            be hoped that future prospects in t ha Sndan will not be too promptly
                            disconntod by excessive speculation ; bnt, at the same time, it would be
                            unwise to leave out of sight the great oommsroial possibi- lities of the
                            country, which is shortly to be more closely linked with the gnat

                        <head>A SATISFACTORY TALE OF PROGRESS.</head>
                        <p>The following are some extracts from the speech of Sheikh Cherif at the
                            distribntion of grants-in-eid on Snnday last</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen,—Yon are aware that the qnes- tion of the improvement of the
                            exi-ting knttabs and the oreation of new institutions of this class has
                            long ooonpied the minds and formed the snbjeot of the discussions of
                            Egyptians, This is explained by the fact that the knttabe are the only
                            means for the propagation of elementary ednoation in Egypt, and the ne-
                            oessary base for all superior education and instruction, whioh are
                            indispensable for the improvement of the nation and its assured
                            prosperity. The Government, being preooon- pied with the interest of the
                            country, is taking aotive steps for the improvement of these schools.
                            The inhabitants of the oonntry have been qniok to understand the objeot
                            of the State’s endeavours, and a general movement is on foot to seoond
                            them. Egyptians realise the absolute neoeseity tor the propagation of
                            instruction and ednoation in an epooh in whioh it has beoome impossible
                            for men to remain in ignoranoe and darkness.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Pnblio Instruction, repre- Mating the Government in all
                            that oonoerns education, has considered it beat to pursue its endeavours
                            toward this end in a regular and gradoal manner to aeonre good results,
                            and has resolved so to continue them, what- ever obstacles it may
                            enoonnter. The Wakf knttabs, whioh are not numerous, have assnr- ed
                            resources, and oannot be abolished, are the first that have teen taken
                            in hand. After nomerons difficulties a satisfactory resalt has been
                            arrived at in the oaee of these schools, and the Ministry has tin— tamed
                            its atten- tion to the free knttabs. In spite of obsta- alee it has been
                            able to attract more than half ef these institutions which have
                            submitted to be inspected by the Ministry, obtaining a money grant paid
                            yearly to the most de- serving. </p>
                        <p>Since the application of throe measures, i.e., siuoi 1898, certain
                            important measures have been taken of whioh the following are the
                            chief:— ’ </p>
                        <p>1. The yearly increase of the Bndget for the knttabs. 2. The inorease of
                            the number of inspeotors and snb-inspeotors, of whom there are now 81.
                            3. The inorease in the nnmber of the hours in the normal onnionlnm of
                            the Government schools and knttabs eaoh Thursday and Friday to oomplete
                            the training of.the knttab teachers. 4. The foundation of normal schools
                            for male and female teachers in the knttabs. In two years three schools
                            of this sort have been founded, whioh now train 18 i male and 40 female
                            students. ‘ * 5. The institution of annual examinations bo test the
                            professional capabilities of fikis and arils. 6. —The elaboration of
                            programmes, regula- tions, and roles for the organisation and discipline
                            of the knttabs and the normal sohools......... Despite the short time
                            that has elapsed since the adoption of these measures, their application
                            nnder the control of the Ministry has given, notably this year, remark-
                            able results, as the following facts indicate :—</p>
                        <p>(1).—The nnmber, which increases very year, of knttab wakia and free
                            knttabs that plaoe themselves under the oontrol of the Ministry. The
                            former nnmber 109, with 194 male and 17 female teaohers, the latter
                            4,859, with 6,395 mala teaohers and 33 school mistresses.</p>
                        <p>(2).—The development of the training of teaohers for the knttabs, whioh
                            has made speoial progress siooe the institution of teach- ing oonrses
                            and the foundation of normal sohools. To this development the excellent
                            results of the examination of fikis and arifii last August are
                            das............................ The most satisfactory feature is this,
                            that the majority of those who passed the examine- tions have obtained
                            plaoaa as teaohers. Some, having clearly understood the objeot of thair
                            training at the sohools where they were pre- pared for the examination,
                            preferred to open knttabs themselves rather than aoospt the offer them
                            of employment in existing knttabs.</p>
                        <p>(3). The knttabs under the oontrol of the Mioiatry have made real
                            progress in manage- ment,raligioaa instruction,and in instr otion in
                            other matters, as is proved by(a)the inorease of papila, especially of
                            girls, in the— knttabs. ... (b) by the yearly inowase in (be numbers ot
                            kattafas that deserve e subvention. There are at proa—t 517 first-class
                            knttabe in receipt of grants amounting to LB. 5,098.430 milL and 2,148
                            of the seoond olaas reoeiving grants amounting to LB. 8,185.800
                            mill....(c) The nnmber of advanoed pupils increases every year in tiro—
                            knttabs, — will be shown by statistics shortly, to be published. I hast—
                            to say here that the teaohing of the Kona and of religions prinoip'oa is
                            the objeot of porti- on]— can on the past of the Ministry. The
                            statistics of knttab pnpils learning the Koran by heart give
                            figures..which show that the arrangements of the Ministry are favorable
                            to the learning of the Koran.</p>
                        <p>With the aid of the Ministry of Finance the , Ministry of Public
                            Instruction attempted an important reform which is intimately connected
                            with the improvement of the knttabe. This reform consisted of giving
                            elementary in- dustrial training to certain pupils of the kuttabe with a
                            view to develop the test for professional occupations and to make the
                            people understand that the instruction given in the kuttabe is
                            indispensable for the young <cb n="6"/> both for the aooomplishment of
                            their religious duties and tor the needs of daily life. The H experiment
                            all but failed last year. Bnt the KB attempt has been renewed this yeir.
                            The H Ministry has entered nto an understanding pB with the head of the
                            model workshops at IJj Boulao to the effeot th»t the apprentices of
                            these workshops ere to be chosen from H amoDg the pupils of the Wakf
                            kuttabe.</p>
                        <p>While the Ministry worked to obtain these excellent results it attempted
                            to improve theB knttabs themselves, which were in an in- desoribable
                            state of dilapidation. Bat in view of its moderate resoaroes all that
                            oonld be done under this head was the minimum of repair necessary to
                            preserve the buildings. The real need was their reoonstrnotion, which
                            demanded earns whioh the Ministry was never likely to dispose of. Thns
                            the que-tion of im- proving the sohoolhonses appeared to pres—t an
                            inanrmoantable obstacle, when, at ri»« most critical point, by a
                            providential chanoe, the Wakfs Administration, happily inspired by the
                            goodwill of its direotor, H. E. Abd el Hamil Pasha Assam, came to the
                            aid of the Ministry by m«king an annnal inorease of L B 6,000 in its
                            budget for the improvement of these knttabs and particularly of the
                            kuttab buildings. The Ministry has set apart this year the sum of LE.
                            5,000 lor the construction of six new knttabs, three in Oairo and three
                            in the provinces, and for the repair of 11 knttabs in Cairo. It will be
                            in a position to reconstruct gradually every knttab whioh requires
                            repair.... At the same time the public, which clearly realised the
                            objeot of this improvement of the kuttabe and has grasped the neoeseity
                            of the oombination of all classes in developing instruction, has set to
                            work in every part of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Everywhere buildings suitable for kuttabs are being constructed, some by
                            individuals, some by subscription, especially since the Government has
                            decided to give free grants of land for the construction of kuttabs. Up
                            to date 758 suitable buildings have been con- structed and 187 others
                            are in course of construction. Local oommittees have been formed for the
                            improvement and extension of ednoation and have oolleoted considerable
                            sums for the purpose. </p>
                        <p>The best method of insuring tint these buildings shall always be nsed at
                            kattafas, Le., at soholastio establishments where teaching is given
                            exclusively in Arabic and includes the Koran, religions instruction,
                            caligraphy, ele- mentary arithmetic, etc, is to make buildings wakfs,
                            and qua wakfs, to endow them with property sufficient to ensure their
                            main- tenance continuance in perpetuity. Let us hope that the notables
                            of the country will grasp the advantages of this course and hasten to
                            adopt it By so doing they will give proofs of their foresight and of
                            their zeal in sustaining the dearest interests of the nation.</p>
