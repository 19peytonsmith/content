                    <p>ABYSSINIA. </p>
                    <p>A special telegram which we published in our last issue announced that an
                        agitation had arisen in Abyssinia on the death of Ras Makonnen, the
                        presumptive successor to the Emperor Menelik. But there is no apparent
                        reason why the Emperor should not continue for many years to come to rule
                        the destinies of the Empire which he has done so much to consolidate and
                        extend. There are few more interesting figures in Africa at this moment than
                        the Emperor has succeded in welding the subordinate kinngdoms under his rule
                        into a fairly homogenous State, and in obtaining the recognition of its
                        independence by the European Powers who are its immediate neighbours. But
                        time is required to give permanency to his work and the problem with which
                        the Emperor Menelik is faced is all the more difficult because there is no
                        direct heir to his throne and that the presumed successor has just died. In
                        these circumstances it is perhaps inevitable that there should be intriguing
                        among the ambitious Rases, some of whom, it is believed, have not been
                        disinclined to coquette with the representatives of the European Powers at
                        Adis Abeba. But so long as Abyssinia remains united no single European Power
                        could conquer the country; while it would prove a difficult and costly
                        buisness for Great Britian, France and Italy combined to overcome the
                        resistance which the Abyssinians could offer. But the real difficulty in
                        Abyssinia is Germany, for it is rumoured that Kaiser's Moracco policy is to
                        be repeated in that quarter of the world. It is currently reported on the
                        Continent that he purposses to enter a siplomatic protest against the treaty
                        now being arranged between the Negus on the one part, and the British,
                        French and Italian Governments on the other. This compact does not infringe
                        in the slightest degree on any German interests in Abyssinia, shadowy as
                        they are; traders of that nationally will be as free to carry on commercial
                        buisness as those of the signatory Powers. The main purpose of the
                        arrangement is to shut out  foreign politicial intrigue by a self-denying
                        ordance between the three European Powers which have secured a solid footing
                        in Menelik's domininons. For a considerable time he has been patiently but
                        firmly striving for that object, and the treaty represents the outcome of
                        his statemanship. Practically, it amounts to the neutralisation of
                        Abyssinia, both politically and commercially, the guarentors being the three
                        Powers most closely concerned in its peaceful development. It is absurd,
                        therefore, for Germany to question their right to come to an agreement
                        which, so far from injuring whatever trading interests the Kaiser imagines
                        to exist, must benefit them in common with those of all other foreign
                        nations. </p>
