                    <head>THE FRONTIER QUESTION</head>
                    <p>As was to be expected, the news of the projected bombardment of Akaba has
                        received an official denial. The question of Tabah - not of Akaba, which is
                        unquestionably Turkish—will be decided, if anywhere, at Constantinople and
                        we believe that Sir Nicholas O’Conor’s representations will finally persuade
                        the Ottoman Government to withdraw its troops from Trbah and the Nekb el
                        Akaba. But though the incident will, we believe, be terminated to the
                        -satisfaction of the British and Egyptian Governments it mast not be
                        supposed that we shall hear no more of the Sinai frontier question. On the
                        contrary, unless that frontier is properly delimitated further incidents of
                        this sort are probable, especially when the completion of the Damasoas
                        Aleppo-Birsjik and the Bregli-Birpjik lines link Constantinople and the
                        Anatolian provinces with the Red Sea. We admit the difficulty of persuading
                        the Porte to come to any agreement as to the delimitation of the frontier,
                        and we realise that strong action on the part of the Home Government may
                        throw the Porte into the arms of a rival European Power—a result that our
                        statesmen obviously cannot desire.</p>
                    <p>The desire of the Ottoman Government to make Akaba a supply base for the
                        Hedjaz railway is natural and laudable enough, and in view of recent events
                        in the Yemen we can understand that the Porte is extremely anxions to
                        safeguard its position in Arabia by every means in its power. It is
                        possible, therefore, that British diplomatic representations may be regarded
                        with a certain amount of suspicion at Yildiz for the myth of British and
                        Egyptian designs on Arabia and Syria has been sedulously propagated in the
                        Turkish Empire. But, after making all allowances for Ottoman mistrust, the
                        foot remains that the Tarkish troops have crossed the Egyptian frontier and
                        have refused to evacuate the positions which they have occupied and that the
                        Government of Egypt and the British Government, which has important
                        interests to defend in this country, cannot, out of deference to the
                        Sultan,abandon their demand for the evacuation of the district now occupied
                        by his troops.</p>

                    <head>THE PRINCE TOUR !</head>
                    <p>"The Daily Telegraph,” in a leading article, reviews the tour of the Prince
                        and Princess of Wales in India, and adds the following interesting commenta
                        on the visit to Egypt. Remarking that the tonr is not concluded with the
                        farewells said in India, the journal alludes to the call which the Renown
                        makes at Port Said "to give the Royal,party an opportunity of seeing at
                        least a few of the wonders of Egypt” Some of those wonders date baok to the
                        most remote periods of antiquity—a thousand yeas are to Egypt no more than a
                        hundred elsewhere in the Old World, and no more than ten in the New —others
                        belong to the last few years of our own time. The latter stand to the credit
                        of a handful of Englishmen rather than to the credit of England. No one can
                        be particularly proud of the Egyptian policy of British statesmen during the
                        critical eighties of last century, and for some years later. They did not
                        know their own mind, and waited on events. Happily for England, however,
                        there was one Enlishman in Egypt who did know his mind, and British
                        statesmanship has since retrieved its reputation by giving him its implicit
                        confidence. The regenerate Egypt, which is now the envy and wonder of the
                        world, is the handiwork of Lord Cromer, assisted, as he has been, by a
                        succession of brilliant men, trained under his direction. In spite of the
                        Capitulations, in spite of persistent opposition offered in the early years
                        by other nations, in spite of the enormous debt by which Egypt was saddled,
                        and the evil tradition of Ismail’s ruinous extravagance, in spite of the
                        entirely anomalous position of the British resident and the British
                        Government in a country nominally independent, save for the suserainty of
                        the Saltan, Egypt has been recreated on a sound financial and commercial
                        basis. The prosperity of the country has leaped up in the last demule, and
                        for the first time for centuries the wretched, downtrodden fellaheen have
                        had their full share in the bounties which have been scattered along the
                        Nile Valley. Where the fellah earned two piastres he now earns three ; the
                        Government have rescued him from thelooal usurer, reduced his taxes, and
                        raised the tide and overflow of the Nile, on which the welfare of Egypt has
                        always depended. To the south, the great provinces of the Sudan have been
                        reclaimed from the most atrocious savagery, and a railway now runs from the
                        Red Saa across tha waste c! sand to tha new oapital which has risen on the
                        ruins of Gordon's Khartoom. The work is not yet finished. Indeed, it has bat
                        just begun. Hardly more than the foundations, in the opinion of those who
                        have faith in Egypt's fata re, have been laid, and vast schemes of
                        irrigation will take many years and many millions before they oan be oarried
                        into effect. But the triumph already achieved is a splendid monument of what
                        capable Englishmen oan do in the way of governing men, if they are not
                        hampered by interfering politicians 'at home. The Prinoe of Wales does well
                        to oonolade his Indian tonr with a visit to Egypt Bat for. India there would
                        be no British Agent ia Cairo ; but for Indian experieaoe it is hardly
                        oonoeivable that Englishmen would have been able so soon to set Egypt on her
                        feet again. The visit of the Prinoe and Prinoess is tha best oompliment that
                        can be paid to the organising genius of Lord Cromer.</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <head>SICILY.</head>
                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="article">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be

                        <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                            Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                            excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing
                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to

                        <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to

                            from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from
