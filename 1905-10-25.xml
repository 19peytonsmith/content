                    <p>THE KAISER AND ISLAM</p>
                    <p>Our London Correspondent's special tele-
                    gram of yesterday will be no surprise to those
                    who have observed the attempts made by the
                    German Government to obtain the support of
                    thw Moslem veracular Press for its policy in
                    Morocco. Two Moslem newspapers are reported 
                    to have received subventions from that Go-
                    vernment to this end, and such as long as their
                    exceelent editors confine themselves to beland-
                    ing the efforts of the European supporters of
                    the ruler of Morocco- and at the same time
                    complacently noting the number and perfec-
                    rions of the danseuses, singers, musicians, and
                    claqueurs recently imported from Egypt by his
                    Sherifan Majesty- all is for the best, and the
                    Maison Britanniqe can continue its business
                    in peace. But should Mustapha Pasha Kamel's 
                    article in reality represent the feelings of a 
                    large section of the Moslem world, the owners
                    of that admirable establishment and its nu-
                    merous branches would be justified in leophol-
                    ing their shutters and putting on an extra
                    guard of day and night watchmen, and its
                    staff would not incur the reproach of timi-
                    dity if they manifested a certain eagerness to
                    take every possible precaution against burglary
                    or fire. But the case is, we believe, quite other-
                    wise. What does Berlin really stand for in the
                    Moslem world, and what section of that world
                    does Mustapha Pasha Kamel represent.</p>
                    <p>The German Emperor has a certain personal 
                    popularity in parts of the Turkish Empire.
                    The Sherif of Morocco counts gleefully upon
                    his future assistance, and those Arabs of the 
                    East African Coast, who have not passed before
                    firing parties, own him as their ruler, but 
                    what interest have the Persians, the 70 mil-
                    lions of Indian Moslems, the Kabyles and
                    Arabs of Algeria, and the nomads of Arabia, in 
                    furthering the aims ascribed to the Emperor
                    William. Again, what Moslem party does
                    Mustapha Pasha Kamel represent? He may 
                    have some influence in Turkey, though we
                    are assured that almost all comment on the
                    "Nationalist," leader in Syria is adverse.
                    Are the Pahjabi Moslem, the Pathan, and
                    the Shiah Persian to be reckoned among his 
                    followers. The sons of the hill-men who fol-
                    lowed John Nicholson through the Kashmir
                    gate at Delhi, and who followed their
                    British leaders to victory in the north,
                    are hardly likely to follow "Al Lews," and 
                    who are the Pasha's followers in Egypt?
                    A group of young men, who consider them-
                    selves capable of managing Egypt, the Sudan,
                    and the Moslem world; a tiny handful of honest
                    nationalists; and those jackals of every party
                    that opposes progress who were once plea-
                    santly described by an Anglo-Egyptian as
                    "Lew(a)d fellows of the baser sort." Large 
                    crowds listen to the Pasha's orations. We
                    admit his eloquence and wit, though we
                    deplore the perversity of his ideas and
                    his entire absence of humour,-but eloquence
                    attracts an Arab crowd before all others. Who
                    of the thousands who crowd to hear and
                    applaud him, will follow Mustapha Kamal.</p>
<p>The Pasha is, in our opinion, acting unconscious-
                   ly as Germany's drummer. THe roll of his eloquen-
                   ce suggests conquest and world-rule, the Kaiser
                   and Sultan Mustapha allied. Emporers of the
                   East and West, but its real onjects is a con-
                   cession for a quay in Morocco or for a railway
                   in Mesopotamia granted to the enterprising
                   Teuton, and perhaps- an order for the 
                   Nationalist leader, if the German Goverment
                   is really in as prickly a mood as our corres-
                   pondent believes. ASs for the representatives
                   of Germany in Egypt, official and civil, we
                   need not say that theit excellent public and
                   private relations with the British element in
                   Egypt and the representatives of the Occupa-
                   tion are in our opinion a proof that the
                   German nation, whatever the attitude of a 
                   vocal Chauvinist section, which is unfortunately 
                   too strongly represented if high quarters at
                   Berlin, is ready to accept the British Occupation
                   and the peculiar position held by our country
                   in Egypt as a guarantee of that country's peace
                   and progress. For one supporter, European or
                   native, of Mustapha Pasha Kamel, Lord
                   Cromer and the Egyptian Government reckon
                   thousands.

<p> The butchers’ strike here resulted in fierce
rioting. The mob attempted to sack the public
buildings. The police fired repeated volleys.
There are 12 killed and 80 wounded. The
garrison was absent at manoeuvres, and the
citizens were called out to maintain order.
Rioting and looting still continue here. Over
five hundred were killed and wounded on
Sunday and Monday, including numbers of
police. The rioters stopped the trains from
starting to fetch the troop's. The agitation has
spread to <placeName>Valparaiso</placeName>. The trouble is due to the
heavy tax on <placeName>Argentine</placeName> cattle.	(Reuter) </p>

organisation, the aim of which is political
freedom.</p>
<p> 20,000 strikers, including students at a

The demonstrators fired revolvers at the
troops, and threw bombs among them. The ,

<p> Rumoured Arrest op Jewellers. — We
are officially informed that the statements
re the arrest of several local jewellers which
have appeared in the columns of certain of
our contemporaries are inaccurate. However,
on enquiring as to the actual facts we were
given to understand that something had happen-
ed, but that the interests of justice and of the
public prevented any disclosures from being
made to the Press. We therefore have a right
to presume that arrests are impending,
and that certain Alexandrian jewellers have
been swindling the public for some time. Have
they by, any chance acquired Government
stamps for hall-marking metal? There are
numerous rumours to that effect.</p> 
<p> Murder at Samatai.—Several thieves, of

of the incident, and a Parquet official from
<placeName>Dessouk</placeName>, the Mamour of the Markaz, and the
Doctor of <placeName>Tanta Markaz</placeName> set out to <placeName>Samatai</placeName>.
They there saw the murdered ghaffik and after
the necessary enquiry they allowed the body to
be buried.The weapons used in the murder,and
the clothes stained with blood, were produced at
the enquiry, and the murderers, who were
identified as <persName>Nadgi Allam</persName>, <persName>Abdul Kader el

have since been captured, pot in irons, and
taken to the prison of Dessouk.</p> 
<p> Bride Disappears. —A marriage was recent
ly arranged between a Moslem boy of eleven
and a girl of twelve years of age. The wed-
ding day was fixed, and at the ceremony the
little bridegroom was taken from his home by
the “best men" and his friends to a cafe some
distance from the house, according to the old
custom entitled "El Huroub" (i.e. flight) in
which the bridegroom flees from the house
which the bride enters in his absence. This
action on the part of the bridegroom is
supposed to signify that he leaves his boost
open to his bride, who must enter first. Tired
out by the excitement of the day the bride-
groom slept till his friends in the cafe
found it time to return and bade him awake
The poor child, fatigued and dazed, collapsed
and had to be driven, fast asleep again, to the
house, where his friends found that mourning
and lamentation had replaced the usual cries
of joy and musical orgies which accompany a
Moslem wedding. The bride, finding the crowd
and noise very tiresome, and being extremely
bored by the old women who chattwred to her,
thought that she might as well leave a cere-
mony which she did not understand or appre-
ciate, and disappeared. And the strangest part
of the story is that nothing has been seen of
her since her disappearance.</p></div>

<div type ="item"><head> CITY’S NEW FILTERS.</head>
<head> INAUGURATION BY KHEDIVE.</head>
<head> YESTERDAY'S CEREMONY.</head> 
<p> The new system of American Jewell filters
which have been installed at the Alexandria
Waterworks, and which have been supplying
the town with purer water for some time now,
were formally inaugurated by H.H. the Khe-
dive yesterday, in the presence of a purely
official gathering. Invitations, which had
been sent out by the Alexandria Municipality
and the Water Company conjointly, were re-
stricted to members, past and present, of the
Municipality, the magistracy, the Army, the
heads of religious denominations, and the
chiefs of the various Government and munici-
pal departments.</p>
<p> The ceremony was timed to take place at
4.30 p m., and his Highness arrived with his
usual well-known punctuality. He drove up to
Rond Point, accompanied by H.E. the Go-
vernor, and escorted by his Body Guard. On
reaching the grounds of the Water Company,
his Highness was received, at the foot of the
carpeted staircase leading to the “settling”
basins, by the members of tho company’s board
and the Municipal Councillors. After shaking
bands with a number of those present, his
Highness conducted by <persName>Mr. J.E. Cornish</persName>,
jun, manager of the Water Company pro tem,
to the settling basins, it being the intention of
the company to show the Khedive the whole
process of filtration from start to finish, in
other words, from the moment that the muddy
polluted water enters the filters from the
<placeName>Mahmoudieh Canal</placeName>, until it is discharged as
pure as crystal into the distributing mains of
the city.</p>
<p> The water from the canal is pumped first of
all by one set of engines into a distributing
reservoir, from which it is led off to each of
the three settling basins, on its way being
mixed with a solution of sulphate of alum
which acts as a precipitant, causing a large
quantity of mud to deposit before the water
reaches the filters. These settling basins
are divided by a (mid-wall so arranged that
the surface water from the first half of the
basin flows to the bottom of the second half
of the basin and again from the surface
of the second half to the filter tanks. There
was a very marked difference noticeable in
the clearness of the water between the first and
second half of the basins, and still more so
between that and the dirty water first let into
the basins.</p>
<p> After his Highness had gone over the whole
of the basins, listening attentively to the
explanations of <persName>Mr. Cornish</persName>, and, followed by
the invited guests, he was conducted to the
filter house, passing on the way through a small
auxiliary engines house, fitted with two high-
speed engines arranged to drive a pair of high-
lift centrifugal pumps for the washing process
of the filters. These engines which are by
Bellis and Morcom, Ltd., Binrmihgham, also
drive the electric dynamo supplying the electric
light for the whole, of the waterworks and the
shafting used for working the agitators of the 
filters. Above this engine-house are situa-
ted the bacteriological laboratory and the
installation tor mixing and supplying the alum
solution to the muddy water.</p>
<p> The filter-house proper is constructed on
the top of tho filter, water reservoir, in such
away that the water from those filters falls 
directly into this reservoir, whenever it is pumped
by a second and more powerful set of electric
into the mains of the town.This filter-house is
divided into two stages, and a start was made at
the upper stage, which is what may be called,
tbe operating platform, where the whole of I
the manipulation of the water is carried out.
One filter, which had been working for
some time, had been emptied for the occasion 
and a section through the sand made which
showed the thick deposit of mud in the top
layers of the sand gradually decreasing
throughout the depth of the sand until at a
depth of 10 inches the sand was quite free
from mud. His Highness was then taken to
another filter and shown the whole process
of filtration, in which he evinced the greatest 
interest. During the process samples of the
water were taken in test tubes each half I
minute, showing how the water gradually
became clearer and clearer.</p>
<p> His Highness was afterwards conducted to
the lower s'age of the filter-house, where tho
intricate system of pipes, valves, and regula-
tors connected with each filter-bed was seen in
working order, and then proceeded to the main
engine house, where he was shown the electric
recording instruments connected with the
settling basins, the filtered water reservoirs,
the town reservoir, and the main pumping
engines supplying the water to the town. His
Highness was greatly struck by the very con-
venient manner in which all the gauges and
the starting and regulating mechanism of the
engines were arranged, a single man being able
'o control the whole of these without moving
from one spot. The boiler-house was then
visited and afterwards the workshops of the
company.</p>
<p> At the conclusion of the inspection the
Khedive expressed himself to <persName>Mr. Cornish</persName> as
being exceedingly pleased with and interested
in the plant. Although his Highness was himself
conversant with the system (having had fitted
up at his palace at <placeName>Montazah</placeName> the original
plant on which the company's experiments
were carried out) he was the more interested
in seeing the way in which the system had
been so expanded as to deal with an immensely
larger volume of water.</p>
<p> An adjournment was then made to a well-
supplied buffet, which had been erected in a
beautifully arranged alcove in the garden, where
his Highness thanked the directors for their
courtesy and gave expression to tho pleasure
which he had derived from the visit After
partaking of some refreshment, and shaking
hands with his guests the Khedive drove away,
as he had come, attended by H.E. the Go-
vernor.</p>
<p> It is interesting to note that the new filter
plant,which must be considered as an immense
boon to the inhabitants of the city, has taken
ondsr throe years to lay down. The filters
were supplied by the Jewell Filter Company of
New York, the engines by <persName>Douglas</persName> and <persName>Grant</persName>,
of Kirealdy. </p>
<p> The work of erecting the filters has been
carried out under the supervision of Mr.
H.R.C. Blagden, the company's chief en-
gineer, aided by <persName>Mr. A. M.</persName> Tennant, while
<persName>Mr. Lawton</persName>, has represented of the Jewell
Filter Co.</p></div>

<p> London, Tuesday, Oct. 24.</p>
<p> <persName>M. Jaures</persName>, the Socialist leader, in an article
on the tendencies of <placeName>German</placeName> Foreign policy, 
remarks that it is impossible for Republican 
France to associate herself therewith. He adds 
that the French Socialist party to which he
belongs will never cease combating <placeName>Germany's</placeName> 
attempt to secure privileged treatment in 
<placeName>Turkey</placeName>. </p> 
<p> <placeName>Germany</placeName>, he says, has made it her policy to 
flatter and support the present Sultan, and 
this policy is to a great extent responsible for 
the horrors of the Ameenian massacres and the
sanguinary anarchy now prevailing in <placeName>Mace- 
donia.</placeName></p>	
<p> It was the special assistance of <placeName>Germany </placeName>

otherwise have yielded to the mandate of

<head> ASTONISHING ARTICLE. </head>
<head> ANTI-BRITISH INCENTIVES. </head>
<head>(Gazette’s Special Service).</head>
<p> London, Tuesday Oct 24.</p>
<p> The "Berliner Tageblatt" gives great pro- 
minence to an article written by Mustapha
Pasha Kamel, Editor of "Al Lewa,” stating
that three hundred million Moslems, inspired 
by the same feelings and beliefs, will prove a 
most powerful factor in international politics.
Napoleon dreamed of becoming the Emperor
of the world of Islam ; A German Kaiser has 
the same ideas, and his visits to to chief 
Moslem capitals prove his sympathy with
the Moslem faith and peoples.</p>
<p> From <placeName>Tangier</placeName> to Peking Mohamedans watch 
his career, wondering if it can be really pos-
ble that a Christian Emperor could become
the friend and patron of <placeName>Islam</placeName>. They feel
grateful for his attitude during the Armenian
crisis; and his assurances of friendship to Mo-
hamedans daring his visit to Syria and
<placeName>Palestine</placeName> have created a genuine sympathy for
<placeName>Germany</placeName> among <placeName>Moslems</placeName>.</p>
<p> <persName>Mustapha Pasha Kamel</persName> argues that it is
grave mistake on the part of <placeName>Germany</placeName> to 
watch the growth of British influence in
<placeName>Egypt</placeName> with indifference, and promises the
friendship of Islam to any European Power 
energetically opposing England in Egypt. i
Great surprise is manifested that the “Berliner Tageblatt”
has thought to publish this
article, and the fact is regarded as a further 
symptom of Germany's pin-pricking policy 
which may eventually reocil upon her.</p></div>

<head> ENTERIC FEVER AND THE
ARMY.</head>

<p><persName>DR. LEIGH</persName> CANARY’S SCHEME</p>
<p><persName>Dr. Gallwey</persName> writes to the “Time.” from
<placeName>Simla</placeName> as follow.
Sir,—In The Times of August 22, 1905,
there is a leading article dealing with the
important Subject of “Armies and Enteric
Fever,” and calling attention to the part <persName>Dr.
Leigh Canney</persName> has taken to endeavouring to
remove this great cause of Army ineffificiency
both in peace and war, at the same time throw-
ing the blame on the military or other anthori-
ties for not carrying out the complete aid
proposes to prevent enteric fever in any
British Force, because a method of protection,
advocated by one man based on his advisory
administration and experience gained, in con-
nexion with camps formed for the construction
of the <placeName>Nile Dam</placeName> at <placeName>Assousn</placeName>, is not forthwith
adopted. </p>
<p>It is stated that the most obvious applica-
tions of science are treated with, absolute
neglect by the War Office. As a medical officer
of the Army I have always taken a deep
interest to the prevention of the disease, and
especially now that I occupy the important
paring of Principal Medical Officer of His
Majesty’s Forces to Indie, and before going on
with the principal object of this letter it would
perhaps be well to explain shortly the sanitary
organisation of the Army in this country. 
At Army headquarters, and the headquarters
of commands divisions, and brigades, there are
sanitary officers with laboratories. In
each station there are two sanitary officers,
one for the cantonment generally, and one for
the civil population living to and about the
bazaars; a cantonment committee assembles
, monthly, and oftener if necessary, to discuss
sanitary and other matters, both sanitary
officers being members of the committee. In
every unit has a medical officer
specially detailed to look after its sauitation.
It will be seen from this that the sanitary
personnel and equipment is on a sound footing,
and since the establishment of this schema
now in existence about four years, it is claimed
that the health efficiency of the Army has been
much increased. One of the most recent ap-
pointments created is an “Inspector of Heath
Efficiency," whose duty it is to teach men
personal hygiene, and to bring up to a healthy
level those who through ignorance or laziness
lower the activity of the Army to this respect</p>
<p> With this scientific machinery at our, dis-
pposal we have been successful in reducing the
admissions to hospital, the time spent-in
hospital, and the death rate, Until today we
have the healthiest army in India since
1882. But while this progress has been going
On in the prevention of disease, the great
stumbling-block in our way has been and is
enteric fever.</p>
<p> It is needless to remark that with such
success already gained in the field of pre-
ventive measures this disease has not been
lost sight of.</p>
<p> We have tried numerous plans and system-,
and the boiling of water advocated by <persName>Dr.
Canney</persName> to the oldest of one methods of pre-
vention, and is universally carried out wher-
ever the water is under the least suspicion,
and always during an epidemic. </p>
<p> But during our close and continuous scien-
tific investigation of this disease in recent
years it has been forcibly brought home to
us all that enteric is seldom waterborne in
<placeName>India</placeName> (principally, I think, owing to the
flat nature of the country and the absence
of sewers), and therefore all our schemes for
sterilisation of water by boiling or otherwise
have had no effect in controlling its inci-
dence or stamping out outbreaks.</p>
<p> <persName>Dr. Canney</persName> tries, In my opinion, to harmo-
nise facts with an ingenious theory
To commence with, all bis scheme is based
on the success he himself claims to, have
obtained by advising the boiling and protec
tion of drinking water for the forge popula-
tion camped at <placeName>Assouan</placeName> during the construc-
tion of the dam. He has forgotten to tell us
where his statistics are to be found, and,
what is of much more importance for the
advancement of sanitary science, he has omit-
ted to inform us what other measures he
advised should be taken to order to
these long-standing camps free from disease.
Apparently these wonderful camps were the
healthiest that ever existed all due to cooked
water.</p>

<p><persName>Dr. Canney</persName> has brought his extraordinary
success to notice only after the completion
of the dam and the breaking up of the camps.
Surely such ideal sanitary administration
should have been the school of instruction
for experts all the world over, and a visit
there would hare well repaid any trouble,
but l am not aware that any such fool
not even by the sanitary experts of
<placeName>Lower Egypt</placeName>.</p>

<p> But <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>, while proclaiming to the 
world his phenomenal advisory powers, has
committed the grave error from a public point
of view of concealing important consideration
which I will now bring to notice, and which
I think will show that his scheme is not laid
on very secure foundations. I have served many
years in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and it is well known that the
natives of the country, also of <placeName>India</placeName> and the
tropics generally, suffer very little in adult life
from enterie. It is notorious also that the 
Southern races of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, <placeName>Italians</placeName>, <placeName>Greek</placeName> &amp;
more especially those who have resided some
time in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, are also practically immune in
adult life, owing to the fact that they live in
insanitary surroundings during infancy and
childhood, and probably suffer from the disease
during this period and so acquire immunity
As all events, their infantile death-rates are
appalling, which would lead one to suppose the
survivors are proof against filth disease.</p>

<p> These were the people, I assume, who formed
the bulk of the population inhabiting the
Assouan camps, and it is not surprising under
the circumstances that they were free from
enteric fever. It would have been difficult to
give it to them. Another consideration worthy
of notice is that, if there, is one axiom more
generally accepted in sanitation than others, it
is that long occupation of camps tend to make
them unhealthy, at all events for the British
soldier, even if the strictest precautions are
taken.</p>

<p> I should have liked to pay a surprise inspec-
tion when <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>’s camps were in full
swing. Of course I will be told that no camps
ever were like them in cleanliness, order, and
discipline; but I am afraid, now that they
have been swept away, I cannot take this for
granted, looking to the population that had to
be dealt with, and knowing the extreme diffi-
culty of maintaining health in peace time, to
say nothing of war, among disciplined troops
in camp.</p>

<p> I assume, therefore, these Assouan camps
ware not quite as perfect as they might be, and
if an immune population had not inhabited
them, enteric fever would have been with
difficulty excluded from them.</p>
<p>Another point is, these camps were adjacent
to the desert on one side and a river on the
other, the fiie air therefrom helping to a great
extant to keep up their reputed high level of
health. Finally, the camps must have been-
almost totally evacuated daring the working
hours of the day, thus assisting their aeration
and cleanliness.</p>

<p>This is all I have to say about <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>
and <placeName>Assouan</placeName>. In his pamphlet “Typhoid, the
Destroyer of Armies, and its Abolition,’' he
appeals to ancient and modern history.. I am
unable to follow him in the former, but in the
latter he instances the Abyssinian, Suakin,
and Ashanti campaigns as favoring his water
theory, because special measures had to be
taken to provide water his Abyssinia and
Suakin, and in Ashanti the water was thought
to be highly polluted, therefore special pre-
cautious were advised to be taken, with the
result (according to <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>) that there
was a marked absence of preventable disease
These were short, sharp, decisive campaigns
on virgin soil and with almost continuous 
movement of all troops. In the early stage-
of war troops are comparatively free from
zymotic affections; then comes the middle
stage of disease ; and finally the veteran im-
munity stage. These wars quoted by<persName> Dr.
Canney</persName> were all completed in their active
stages well under six months In Ashanti-
filters were used, bat I doubt very mach if
any extensive boiling operations went.on,
for there was no Royal Water Corps. Filters
have been abolished in <placeName>India</placeName>, because they
were found to cultivate and preserve the
bacilli of disease.</p>

<p>Then, in his historical review we come to
<placeName>South Africa</placeName>, where 51,000 casualties, includ-
ing over 7,000 deaths, are attributed to con-
taminated water. This statement of cause
and effect should make the British public sit
up and force the authorities to adopt the
“water cure.”</p> 
<p>From my experience in <placeName>South Africa</placeName>, and
this opinion has been strongly 'confirmed since,
my arrival in <placeName>India</placeName>, polluted water was not
the main cause, it was probably only a minor
cause of the prevalence of enteric during the
war. I think we, are all agreed that you cannot
get this disease unless the bacillus is intro
duced into the System by some means or
other. Why, may I ask, is water seized on as
the chief vehicle this disease? It is because
it is a necessity of life, taken freely, and
omnipresent. At <placeName>Paardeberg</placeName> the Army na-
turally camped near the rim, and many
imagine that this river water has the fons et
origo of the Bloemfontein epidemic. No
matter how filthy the river was, no matter
hew contaminated with animal and human
dead from Cronje’s laager, if it did not contain
the bacilli it could not give enteric. It is well
known to scientists that the enteric bacillus
is very rarely found in water even after pro-
longed investigation, and that in polluted
water its life is very short, as tested by ex-
periment. Why, therefore, pronounce water
the principle vehicle of the bacillus It is not
its habitat, and it rapidly dies in it.
During the long hard fighting and bivoweck
ing on the Tugela heights away from the river,
to drank filth/ water to my knowledge,
in fact anything they could get, for the water
question was a very serious difficulty, there
was no enteric.</p>
<p> It pas only when, long after, they went into
overcrowded camps and tents after the relief
of Ladysmith that the disease broke out in an
epidemic form.</p>
<p>Roberta's army at Bloemfontein and Buller’s
army in Natal are parallel cases in connexion
with epidemic disease.</p>
<p>Enteric was not necessarily caused by the
rivers at Paardeberg and Ladysmith,
but in my opinion by. the grime, dust, dirt of
war, which harbour the bacilli on the human
being on his clothes, on his bedding, on his 
food, &amp;, while the overcrowding of tents and
ground — a necessity of war — spreads the
disease by contact and by lowering vitality.
<persName>Dr. Canney</persName> says bacilli have no geographical
limits, but he does not point out that in the
densely populated tropics they are more
numerous, and, therefore; can gain access to
the body by many more avenues than in well
organised sanitary town's in temperate climates,
the immune spread them, the exotic fresh
arrivals are attacked. He harps on the Laissez
boire which results in typhoid, dysentery,
diarrhea, and cholera, doubling sick  lists,
swelling invaliding, blocking hospitals, em-
barrassing the March and reducing the fighting
strength but he neglects to state that chloera,
has been pratically abolished and dysentery
reduced, by improvements in sanitation and
the introduction of pure water supplies into
stations in <placeName>India</placeName>, while these measures, have
had no effect on the incidence of enteric fever,</p>

<p>The three years subsequent to the introduction
of the universal system of boiling of water are
remarkable for an exceptional increase in the
prevalence of enteric fever, viz:- Admissions
-1896, 1,795; 1897, 2,010; 1898, 2,375. All
the sanitary authorities in <placeName>India</placeName> are wrong if
<persName>Dr. Canney</persName> is right.</p>

<p> We are the scientific workers, he is the
armchair theorist. According to the annual
report for British troops in India for the year
1904, the only stations where outbreaks are
attributed to water are—(1) Mhow, where the
patients say they got it from swallowing water
when bathing in the plunge bath; (2) Kamptee,
one case from drinking water from a nullah
on a field day; (3) Bereilly, one case from
drinking dirty-water from a pitcher; and (4)
Wellington, where an outbreak of 17 cases was
said to have been due to contaminated er, wat
but the bacillus was not found. These are all
the cases, out of a total of 1,384 occurring in-
<placeName>India</placeName> during 1904, which the medical officers
of the Army put down as caused by water. On
the other hand, the following carriers of the
bacilli and avenues of attack have been strongly
insisted on: the human host by personal
contact and ambulatory cases, latrines, dust,
flies, milk, fruit, raw vegetables, bazar supplies
generally, hat specially sweet-meats and
aerated waters ; in abort almost everything
but water. These are put down in order of
importance, and in endeavouring to reduce the
incidence of the disease we are noting in this
sequence, by seeing to rigid isolation (of too
sick, suspicious canod pouts lessen taj: by
disinfection (a proposal has recently been
made to allow the wood sanctioned for boiling,
drinking water in stations to be used for the
sterilisation of excreta by boiling).; by evacua-
tion of barracks; and by the partial segrega-
tion of regiments and drafts freshly;) arrived in
the country, in order to prevent dissemina-
tion of the disease from this this source, which has
been found to be a fruitful cause of its spread
in stations.</p>
<p> In your leading article on <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>’s
letter it is stated that “germs, when received
into water containing organic matter of other
kinds, are placed in circumstances highly
conducive to their indefinite increase and to
toe conservation of their virulence." This is
not so. Typhoid bacilli live longer in sterile
than unsterilised water, and longer in steri-
lised tap water than in sterilised sewage. In
<persName>Frankland</persName>’s experiments they fired 33 days
in deep well water, 19 days in Loch Katrine
and three days in Thames water.</p>
<p> It is also stated as a matter of fact that
polluted drinking water appears to be the
only cause of enteric which need seriously
be dreaded or solicitously guarded against.”
I have already shown that our Indian ex-
perience is dead against tom, and in my
opinion it has also been absoultely disproved
by the American can Commission who report on
an outbreak, during the Spanish-American
war, in regiments using municipal water
supplies, which were decimated, while the
municipalities themselves remained absolute-
ly free from the disease.</p>
<p>Finally your leading article dealt with
the Japanese, stating that they have applied
<persName>Dr. Canney</persName>’s suggestions with complete suc-
cess. We have, I think, yet to learn the
incidence of disease among the troops of the
Mikado, but their reputed relative freedom
from preventible disease can, I think, hardly
be attributed to the so-called complete and
comprehensive scheme advocated by <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>.
The Japanese fought in a country somewhat
similar and near to their own ; they are pro-
bably relatively immune, like all other Eastern
races ; they are fish and rice eaten, and as
regards the physiological processes going on
in their digestion tracts they probably differ
much from the meat eating, gross-feeding, and
alcohol drinking European; it is their custom
to cook all their food and water and baton in
hot water ; they were successful, and could
choose their own ground (in my experience
the healthiest sites are tactically the best) >
and finally they are an exceptionally clean
race, and do all they can to keep themselves
fit, so great is their patriotism. Beyond these
natural conditions, customs, and attributes, I
am informed on the very best authority that
the Japanese sanitary organic nation, about
which we have heard so much from <persName>Seaman
Nurse McCaul</persName>, <persName>Sir Frederick Treves</persName>, and
others, is not in any way in advance of that
in the British Army. It appears that state-
ments as regards' high efficiency of foreign
armies made by such authorities are fully
accepted, while nithing is restored from Army
authorities without great doubt and suspicion.
I trust,' however, it will be gathered from this
letter that the cure of the health of armies is
not such an easy thing it leeks on paper,
but one of the most difficult and complex of 
problems. The men who have been in harness
all their lives, striving strenuosly at all times
and in all places—many of the latter none too
pleasant -to improve the health to efficiency of
the Army, are publicly denounced and held up
to ridicule at the bid of armchair theorists and 
trippers abroad.</p>	
<p> I yield to no one in my anxiety to effect
progress of the adoption of schemes which
will fit in With the whole organisation and
administration of the Forces, no matter from
whom they emanate, but I cannot advocate a
lopsided arrangement like the Reyel Water
Gone, which only proposes to stop a small by-
path on the many roads to enteric</p>
<p> Under existing circumstances the Army
machine is becoming daily more complex and
expensive, and I do not think the present
time favorable for the organisation of a spe-
cial sanitary corps with full disciplinary and
executive powers, and until the opportune
moment arrives we must rest content with the
advisory sanitary system which I have sketched
in this letter (and which to a great extent will
follow the Army into the field) and the educa-
tion of the Army in general sanitation and per-
sonal hygiene. Do what we can,. I am afraid
We can never abolish enteric; which <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>
claims can be dond with his Royal Water Corps.
I will conclude by quoting a remark made to
me in Egypt by a very shrewd foreigner, who
said “You English all die of enteric because 
you take too much violent exercise.” Possibly
there is something in this, and it may explain
the remarkable freedom from enteric of
soldiers’ families to <placeName>India</placeName>, who are presumably
water-drinkers and are exposed to precisely
the same conditions as the men themselves,
except that they take life easy.</p>
<p>I may add to that I am not in favor of limit-
ing exercise, as it is the foundation of the
British character, and interference with the
development of this cannot be seriously con-
templated.</p>
