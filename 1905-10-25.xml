Rioting and looting still continue here. Over
five hundred were killed and wounded on
Sunday and Monday, including numbers of

starting to fetch the troop's. The agitation has
spread to Valparaiso. The trouble is due to the
heavy tax on Argentine cattle.	(Reuter) </p>

<p> Rumoured Arrest op Jewellers. — We
are officially informed that the statements
re the arrest of several local jewellers which
have appeared in the columns of certain of
our contemporaries are inaccurate. However,
on enquiring as to the actual facts we were
given to understand that something had happen-
ed, but that the interests of justice and of the
public prevented any disclosures from being
made to the Press. We therefore have a right
to presume that arrests are impending,
and that certain Alexandrian jewellers have
been swindling the public for some time. Have

numerous rumours to that effect.</p>

<p> Bride Disappears. —A marriage was recent

little bridegroom was taken from his home by
the “best men" and his friends to a cafe some
distance from the house, according to the old
custom entitled "El Huroub" (i.e. flight) in
which the bridegroom flees from the house
which the bride enters in his absence. This
action on the part of the bridegroom is
supposed to signify that he leaves his boost
open to his bride, who must enter first. Tired
out by the excitement of the day the bride-
groom slept till his friends in the cafe
found it time to return and bade him awake
The poor child, fatigued and dazed, collapsed
and had to be driven, fast asleep again, to the
house, where his friends found that mourning
and lamentation had replaced the usual cries
of joy and musical orgies which accompany a
Moslem wedding. The bride, finding the crowd
and noise very tiresome, and being extremely
bored by the old women who chattwred to her,
thought that she might as well leave a cere-
mony which she did not understand or appre-
ciate, and disappeared. And the strangest part
of the story is that nothing has been seen of
her since her disappearance.</p></div>

<div type ="item"><head> CITY’S NEW FILTERS.</head>
<head> INAUGURATION BY KHEDIVE.</head>
<head> YESTERDAY'S CEREMONY.</head> 
<p> The new system of American Jewell filters
which have been installed at the Alexandria
Waterworks, and which have been supplying
the town with purer water for some time now,
were formally inaugurated by H.H. the Khe-
dive yesterday, in the presence of a purely
official gathering. Invitations, which had
been sent out by the Alexandria Municipality
and the Water Company conjointly, were re-
stricted to members, past and present, of the
Municipality, the magistracy, the Army, the
heads of religious denominations, and the
chiefs of the various Government and munici-
pal departments.</p>
<p> The ceremony was timed to take place at
4.30 p m., and his Highness arrived with his
usual well-known punctuality. He drove up to
Rond Point, accompanied by H.E. the Go-
vernor, and escorted by his Body Guard. On
reaching the grounds of the Water Company,
his Highness was received, at the foot of the
carpeted staircase leading to the “settling”
basins, by the members of tho company’s board
and the Municipal Councillors. After shaking
bands with a number of those present, his
Highness conducted by Mr. J.E. Cornish,
jun, manager of the Water Company pro tem,
to the settling basins, it being the intention of
the company to show the Khedive the whole
process of filtration from start to finish, in
other words, from the moment that the muddy
polluted water enters tho filters from the
Mahmoudieh Canal, until it is discharged as
pure as crystal into the distributing mains of
the city.</p>
<p> The water from the canal is pumped first of
all by one set of engines into a distributing
reservoir, from which it is led off to each of
the three settling basins, on its way being
mixed with a solution of sulphate of alum
which acts as a precipitant, causing a large
quantity of mud to deposit before the water
reaches the filters. These settling basins
are divided by a (mid-wall so arranged that
the surface water from the first half of the
basin flows to the bottom of the second half
of the basin and again from the surface
of the second half to the filter tanks. There
was a very marked difference noticeable in
the clearness of the water between the first and
second half of the basins, and still more so
between that and the dirty water first let into
the basins.</p>
<p> After his Highness had gone over the whole
of the basins, listening attentively to the
explanations of Mr. Cornish, and, followed by
the invited guests, he was conducted to the
filter house, passing on the way through a small
auxiliary engines house, fitted with two high-
speed engines arranged to drive a pair of high-
lift centrifugal pumps for the washing process
of the filters. These engines which are by
Bellis and Morcom, Ltd., Binrmihgham, also
drive the electric dynamo supplying the electric
light for the whole, of the waterworks and the
shafting used for working the agitators of the 
filters. Above this engine-house are situa-
ted the bacteriological laboratory and the
installation tor mixing and supplying the alum
solution to the muddy water.</p>
<p> The filter-house proper is constructed on
the top of tho filter, water reservoir, in such
away that the water from those filters falls 
directly into this reservoir, whenever it is pumped
by a second and more powerful set of electric
into the mains of the town.This filter-house is
divided into two stages, and a start was made at
the upper stage, which is what may be called,
tbe operating platform, where the whole of I
the manipulation of the water is carried out.
One filter, which had been working for
some time, had been emptied for the occasion 
and a section through the sand made which
showed the thick deposit of mud in the top
layers of the sand gradually decreasing
throughout the depth of the sand until at a
depth of 10 inches the sand was quite free
from mud. His Highness was then taken to
another filter and shown the whole process
of filtration, in which he evinced the greatest 
interest. During the process samples of the
water were taken in test tubes each half I
minute, showing how the water gradually
became clearer and clearer.</p>
<p> His Highness was afterwards conducted to
the lower s'age of the filter-house, where tho
intricate system of pipes, valves, and regula-
tors connected with each filter-bed was seen in
working order, and then proceeded to the main
engine house, where he was shown the electric
recording instruments connected with the
settling basins, the filtered water reservoirs,
the town reservoir, and the main pumping
engines supplying the water to the town. His
Highness was greatly struck by the very con-
venient manner in which all the gauges and
the starting and regulating mechanism of the
engines were arranged, a single man being able
'o control the whole of these without moving
from one spot. The boiler-house was then
visited and afterwards the workshops of the
company.</p>
<p> At the conclusion of the inspection the
Khedive expressed himself to Mr. Cornish as
being exceedingly pleased with and interested
in the plant. Although his Highness was himself
conversant with the system (having had fitted
up at his palace at Montazah the original
plant on which the company's experiments
were carried out) he was the more interested
in seeing the way in which the system had
been so expanded as to deal with an immensely
larger volume of water.</p>
<p> An adjournment was then made to a well-
supplied buffet, which had been erected in a
beautifully arranged alcove in the garden, where
his Highness thanked the directors for their
courtesy and gave expression to tho pleasure
which he had derived from the visit After
partaking of some refreshment, and shaking
hands with his guests the Khedive drove away,
as he had come, attended by H.E. the Go-
vernor.</p>
<p> It is interesting to note that the new filter
plant,which must be considered as an immense
boon to the inhabitants of the city, has taken
ondsr throe years to lay down. The filters
were supplied by the Jewell Filter Company of
New York, the engines by Douglas and Grant,
of Kirealdy. </p>
<p> The work of erecting the filters has been
carried out under the supervision of Mr.
H.R.C. Blagden, the company's chief en-
gineer, aided by Mr. A. M. Tennant, while
Mr. Lawton, has represented of the Jewell
Filter Co.</p></div>

<p> London, Tuesday, Oct. 24.</p>
<p> M. Jaures, the Socialist leader, in an article

remarks that it is impossible for Republican 
France to associate herself therewith. He adds 
that the French Socialist party to which he
belongs will never cease combating Germany's

<p> Germany, he says, has made it her policy to 
flatter and support the present Sultan, and 
this policy is to a great extent responsible for 
the horrors of the Ameenian massacres and the
sanguinary anarchy now prevailing in Mace- 
donia.</p>	
<p> It was the special assistance of Germany

<head> ASTONISHING ARTICLE. </head>
<head> ANTI-BRITISH INCENTIVES. </head>
<head>(Gazette’s Special Service).</head>
<p> London, Tuesday Oct 24.</p>
<p> The "Berliner Tageblatt" gives great pro- 
minence to an article written by Mustapha
Pasha Kamel, Editor of "Al Lewa,” stating
that three hundred million Moslems, inspired 
by the same feelings and beliefs, will prove a 
most powerful factor in international politics.
Napoleon dreamed of becoming the Emperor
of the world of Islam ; A German Kaiser has 
the same ideas, and his visits to to chief 
Moslem capitals prove his sympathy with
the Moslem faith and peoples.</p>
<p> From Tangier to Peking Mohamedans watch 
his career, wondering if it can be really pos-
ble that a Christian Emperor could become
the friend and patron of Islam. They feel
grateful for his attitude during the Armenian
crisis; and his assurances of friendship to Mo-
hamedans daring his visit to Syria and
Palestine have created a genuine sympathy for
Germany among Moslems.</p>
<p> Mustapha Pasha Kamel argues that it is
grave mistake on the part of Germany to 
watch the growth of British influence in
Egypt with indifference, and promises the
friendship of Islam to any European Power 
energetically opposing England in Egypt. i
Great surprise is manifested that the “Berliner Tageblatt”
has thought to publish this
article, and the fact is regarded as a further 
symptom of Germany's pin-pricking policy 
which may eventually reocil upon her.</p></div>
