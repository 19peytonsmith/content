                <p>of the Storthing, sent to notify Prince Charles</p>
                <p>of his election, and to ask the King's assent,</p>
                <p>was an impressive and brilliant ceremony. The</p>
                <p>King, having assented, tamed deeply moved</p>
                <p>to the Prince and Princess and exhorted them</p>
                <p>to serve their now country loyally, and to win</p>
                <p>the love of the people. “Yon will," he conclud-</p>

                <p>King and grandfather, for yourselves and your</p>

                <p>Prince Charles, as King Hakon VII., sub-</p>
                <p>sequently received the greetings of the Nor-</p>
                <p>wegians at his own Palace. He declared that</p>
                <p>he and his consort would devote their lives for</p>
                <p>Norway’s good. His motto would be : "All for</p>

                <p>London, November 20.</p>
                <p>The “Daily Telegraph” learns from Tokio</p>
                <p>that the Anglo Chinese treaty with regard to</p>
                <p>Tibet has been signed. It is believed that</p>
                <p>England acknowledges Chinese sovereignty in</p>
                <p>Tibet, in return for which China pays an</p>

                <p>between England and Port Said, Cairo, and</p>

                <p>General Officer Commanding the Force in</p>
                <p>Egypt was issued yesterday: - </p>
                <p>The G. O.C. cannot allow the 2nd Bn.</p>
                <p>Rifle Brigade to leave his Command, without</p>
                <p>expressing his regret at losing so smart a</p>
                <p>battalion. In military efficiency and conduct,</p>
                <p>the battalion has kept up the traditions of</p>
                <p>the Brigade to which they belong : and he</p>
                <p>wishes all ranks a hearty farewell, and health</p>
                <p>and success in their new tour of service.</p>

                <p>The hearing of the action brought by M.</p>
                <p>Poutrel against the Hon. A. J. Davey, tor</p>
                <p>wrongful dismissal, was resumed this morning,</p>
                <p>when Me. Carton de Wiart continued his</p>
                <p>defence. His pleading, which was extremely</p>
                <p>eloquent, was supported by a number of docu-</p>
                <p>ments, which, he contended, proved that the</p>
                <p>Hon. A. J. Davey had all along been kept in</p>
                <p>ignorance of the speculative transactions of</p>
                <p>the late M. Cronier and his supporters.</p>
                <p>After the close of the speech Me. Guilha-</p>
                <p>mou replied, following much the same lines</p>
                <p>as on Tuesday last.</p>
                <p>Judgment will, it is expected, be given in</p>

                <p>“Maisons de tolerance" have been issued by the</p>
                <p>ministry of the Interior. They have the police</p>
                <p>large powers to interfere in the interests of</p>
                <p>public order and decency, forbid the employ-</p>
                <p>ment of minors as servants in such houses,and</p>
                <p>forbid any person to occupy or be employed in</p>
                <p>such houses whose career has been marked by</p>
                <p>crime as well as by immorality.</p>
                <p>WHERE IS THE FATHER ?</p>
                <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                <p>Sir,—In last night's “Egyptian Gazette"(Lo-</p>
                <p>cal and General) I read a short article concern-</p>
                <p>ing a young woman named Lettshorn, who was</p>
                <p>sentenced to two years’ imprisonment by the</p>
                <p>Native Assize Court in Cairo, for having killed</p>
                <p>her new born child. It is indeed a very sad</p>
                <p>case. Sadder still, that there should be a law</p>
                <p>inflicting punishment on the poor, seduced,</p>
                <p>perhaps hungry, girl-mother and not on the</p>
                <p>seducer. Why is his name not mentioned in</p>
                <p>the paper? Why should the young woman bear</p>
                <p>all the shame alone, and not share it with the</p>
                <p>man who shared her love? Justice was merciless</p>
                <p>to the heartless mother and lenient to the</p>
                <p>cowardly lover. Such sad cases will occur as</p>
                <p>long as society will allow partiality in law. It</p>
                <p>is time some laws were reformed.</p>
                <p>With thanks, I beg to remain, dear sir,—</p>
                <p>Yours faithfully</p>

                <p>M. Lambert’s company opened well and</p>
                <p>had, if not a full, at least a good house ever</p>
                <p>ready to respond to telling lines and good</p>
                <p>acting, and at times unwilling to reserve its</p>
                <p>applause at the close of an act. That M.</p>
                <p>Lambert's company would do well was expected.</p>
                <p>but no one, in our opinion, counted on hearing</p>
                <p>the parts of Fabrics and Clorinde so brilliantly</p>
                <p>upheld. M. Albert Lambert fils rendered the</p>
                <p>first role with real power; Mlle Delvair as</p>
                <p>Clorinde was brilliant She possesses a fine pre-</p>
                <p>sence, great powers of facial expression, and one</p>
                <p>of those rich voices, so rarely heard, that make</p>
                <p>movement and gesture almost needless when</p>
                <p>they express emotion or passion, so perfect it</p>
                <p>the charm of their intonation. M. Albert</p>
                <p>Lambert pere as Annibal was good, and M.</p>
                <p>Marqnet played his part with dignity—perhaps</p>
                <p>with too much reserve—for the role of a</p>
                <p>distinguished old gentleman who is ready to</p>
                <p>throw himself at the feet of a handsome girl</p>
                <p>with a pathetic certainty that she reciprocates</p>
                <p>his flame, Is rather on the comic side.</p>

                <p>THE TOMBAC MONOPOLY.</p>
                <p>WHY NOT ABOLISH IT?</p>
                <p>The abolition-of the salt monopoly (states</p>
                <p>"A1 Express") has given great satisfaction</p>
                <p>throughout Egypt; and the Government, which</p>
                <p>has deserved the best thanks of the people for</p>
                <p>this action, mast recognize the great harm</p>
                <p>caused by monopolies. Therefore we seize this</p>
                <p>opportunity (adds our contemporary) to draw</p>
                <p>the attention of the Government and of Lord</p>
                <p>Cromer, the great reformer of Egypt, to the</p>
                <p>tombac trade, which has been for 30 years ,a</p>
                <p>monopoly in Egypt. Tombac is so much used</p>
                <p>here that it ought to be considered one of the</p>
                <p>indispensable wants of the people. This mono-</p>
                <p>poly has so far caused great harm to the</p>
                <p>finauces of our country, and our wise reformer</p>
                <p>and the high authorities could put an end to</p>
                <p>it, as they have done to the salt monopoly.</p>

                <p>as to what is eventually to take the place of</p>
                <p>the Z'zinia Theatre, we might point out a</p>
                <p>precedent for Alexandria in the great scheme</p>
                <p>we hear of from New York. Thirty prominent</p>
                <p>men have subscribed £600,000 for the building</p>
                <p>of a fine theatre, and a committee of their</p>
                <p>wives will determine who shall be privileged to</p>
                <p>pay £20,000 apiece for the boxes. If thirty</p>
                <p>public-spirited capitalist; patrons of the opera</p>
                <p>were to do likewise at Alexandria, and the</p>
                <p>Municipality were to turnish a fine site, we</p>
                <p>should have a theatre worthy of Egypt’s com-</p>
                <p>mercial capital.</p>

                <p>the necessity of waging war against the</p>

                <p>a menace to the health and comfort of the</p>

                <p>imbued with the faculty of tantalising and</p>

                <p>and practised would be greatly to enhance</p>
