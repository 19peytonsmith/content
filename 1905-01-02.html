The present variety is more con- fusing than pleasing. The Journel Officiel often contains several spellings fo the same place according as the name is being used by the Public Works, Railway, Finance or other administraion. Nor is an administration always uniform in its method, for the Railway Administration sometimes exhibits in time- table, telegrphic guide, tickets, station home- boards, and lamps all the various forms of spelling. Here are some illustrations of variety taken from official sources:Kalioubieh, Galiou- bieh, Qualiubia; Guzieh, Guiza, Giza; Kena, Keneg, Qena; Assiout, Assyut, Assiut; Ebchan, Ebshan, Ibshan; Barqnaqs, Barknaks.

The stereotyped form could be left to the Survey Department, who have already nearly completed a survey of Egypt embracing every single hamlet, or ezbeh, ezbet, isba, izba, izbit. This department could issue a general index, and also a geographical list with mudiriehs, districts, villages, esbehs. It would be of much use in fixing exact name and locality. Press notices of village occurrences are at times very vague as to locality. Teh el Baroud, often erroneously called Tel, is now spelt Stai el Baroud on Survey maps. The names of natives is a great source of error, and a properly-spelt list would be of much ser- vice.

A slight recrudescence of the disease is noted daring the last week, but this is entirely of a local character, confined to the provinces of Gharbieh and Ghizeh.</p><p>Since the beginning of the outbreak the cattle of the localities infected and neighbouring villages have been inoculated with serum. This has always checked the development oI the disease.

THE NEW TARIFF.</span></h3><p>The new tariff which came into force yesterday on the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Company's line has aroused a considerable amount of indignation among the inhabitants.</p><p>Mr. IL II. Birch sends us the following communication on the subject:—</p><p>The directors of tho Ramleh Railway Company, Ltd., have issued a notice that no further contract tickets will be issued after 31st December, 1904, end that in place of them “carnets,” or books of tickets, will be provided at a price which more-than doubles the cost of the yearly contract. The reasons given for this new departure are-</p><p>I “That many contract holders refuse to show their tickets to the conductors when called upon to do so, and abuse and even assault them." The remedy for this is to send the offenders before tho Tribunals, and exac the penalty for their misconduct.</p><p>II“The company is now a tramway company and no such companies in Europe issue contract tickets.” To this the reply is that it was a railway company when the concession was obtained from the Egyptian Government, and if it has suited the direction to convert the railway into a tramway for their own benefit, it is no reason why the public should be sacrificed.</p><p>The Government, having granted a monopoly to the company, should take care that this monopoly is not abused. The contract holders are mostly old residents, and it is not only the proceeds of their tickets that benefit the company, but also a further benefit accrues from the members of their households and guests who visit them and who do not hold contracts. What is to be the result of this new regulation? The increased charge is altogether immensurate to the service rendered by the company. Numbers of people will have to leave Ramleh, and rents, house property, and land will all decrease in value. It behoves everybody to protest energetically against this regulation, which is unjustifiable from ad points of view.</p><p>This morning we interviewed one of the members of the board of the company, Mr. Lumbroso, who gave us the following exposition of the directors’ standpoint:—</p><p>In no country in the world are there season tickets for electric trams, but only books of tickets. After the electrification of the line, and out of consideration for the public’s demands, season tickets were issued on the condition that every season ticket holder should have his photograph in the ticket case and should show it whensoever asked by the company’s servants. But, continued Mr. Lumbreso, this system has been rendered impossible owing to the "mauvaise volonte” of the public and of the tricks played upon the company by -false season ticket holders, who insulted and attacked the employees when asked to show their tickets. The directors have had to stop issuing season tickets, and have reduced the price of packets of 50 tickets for the first class from P.T. 38 to P.T. 75 and for the second class from P.T. 4.7 to P.T. 37J. This, said Mr. Lumbroso, was a sacrifice made by the company for the sake of the public, since on a total of about L.E. 50,000 the amount realized from season tickets was only L.E. 8,000. On the other hand, tho above must take into consideration the fact that if the present price of the books of ticket appears to be higher than the season ticket rate, the new system has the advantage of allowing them to give away the tickets in the books to their families and servants if they wish to.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.24"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.24. </span><span class="head">PASSENGERS’ LISTS. arrivals.</span></h3><p>Le paquebot “Sirio” de la Cie Florio-Rubat- tino arrive hier de Genes avait 4 bord : M.M.

Angier Brothers, hi declared that the plans are complete for a second Canal across the Isthmus of Suez, and that the contractors are ready to commence its construction, was calculated to mislead the general public into the belief that such a second Canal would really be cut without delay, un- less to use the words of the despatch, “British cargo vessels received fairer treatment at the hands of the present Canal Company."</p><p>Before referring to the grievances of certain shipowners, it is right to point out that the Suez Canal Company possesses a monopoly which will not expire till the Canal, at the end of its concession in about seventy years, passes into the possession of the Egyptian Govern- ment. It is, of course, possible that the present Canal Company should, through violation of its concession, be pronounced to have forfeited its monopoly; but at the present time the complaints do not go so far as that.</p><p>It is probable that if the present Company failed to keep its engagements, the Egyptian Government, would quash its monopoly, and perhaps grant another concession to a new company; but, the British Government, which possesses no fewer than 176,000 of the Suez Canal Shares, and has its representatives on the Board of Directors, has formulated no com- plaint against the management of the enterprise which produces for a sufficiently large revenue to be of appreciable value to the English Treasury.</p><p>If the Canal were mismanaged, the British Government, as the largest shareholder, would certainly be the first to complain; but under present circumstances its representatives are in perfect accord with the president and other members of the board of directors, so that is scarcely likely to advise the Khedive to grant a concession for a second Canal.</p><p>Even supposing the concession were granted by the Egyptian Government, there would still remain the question of the Sovereignty of the Sultan, and of the validity of that con- cession without the ratification of the Porte. It is, therefore, clear that if the plans for the cutting of a second Canal are already prepared, the moment has not yet come when the con- tractors can commence their work.</p><p>With regard to the Canal dues charged on the spaces on deck capable of being utilised for cargo, M. Bonnet, the general secretary of the Company, assured me to-day that the regulations for the measurement of those deck spaces were in complete accord with the deci- sions of the Constantinople Conference, and that, moreover, the Board of Trade approved them. Certain spaces on deck available for cargo were still exempt, and were only taxed for the payment of Canal dues after it had been demonstrated beyond doubt by the ship- owner himself that they were destined to be oc copied with cargo by cargo being found in them. After a vessel has once presented itself in the Canal with cargo in such previously exempted spaces, those spaces are for the future always included in the tonnage on which the Canal tolls are calculated.</p><p>After reading the interview with Sir Theo- dore Angier, published in The Standard of Saturday, I called again on M. Bonnet, who is leaving for Egypt on Tuesday with Prince d'Arenborg. Their visit to the Isthmus is in no way connected with the present agitation in favour of constructing an opposition canal but is simply the annual visit of inspection al- ways made by the President of the Suez Cana Company.</p><p>Sir Theodore Angier (as reported in your issue of December 16) said to your representa- tives :—"We defeated Mr. Gladstone's assump- tion of a monopolist right, and he had to con- foss-that he was wrong. We got a new con- cession."</p><p>“Both these statements,” said M. Bonnet to me today, “are absolutely incorrect. Mr Gladstone never contested the Company's monopoly, and no concession was ever granted for a second Canal."</p><p>The exclusive character of the Suez Canal Company's concession is unquestionable, espe- cially as no one contests that the Canal now completely answers the requirements of the shipping using it. Sir Theodore Angier com- plains that the Suez Canal Company has in many ways violated what is known as “the London programme," signed in 1883. M Bonnet's reply on this point was very clear He said to me, in substance: —‘Sir Theodore Angier contends that our tonnage measurements are arbitrary. The fact is that every vessel using the Canal has two certificates of tonnage. In the case of British ships,t he Board of Trade gives first its home certificate of tonnage, and secondly a Suez Canal certificate, established in conformity with the regulations of that Com- pony, drawn up by the Constantinople Con- ference. Tee Suez Canal authorities naturally base their Canal dues on this latter certificate, and make no-arbitrary charges."</p><p>“With regard to the question of the di- vidend, taken in connection with the re- duction of Canal dues,” went on M. Bonnet “the ‘London programme' suggested that the future augmentation of the profits of the enterprise should be applied in equal parts to increase the dividend on the shares and to reduce the Canal dues. Thus, in 1883 when the dividend on the shares was only 93 francs, the Company made its customers, the shipowners, 4 present of half its even- toal increased profits. This agreement has been kept so for several years till 1891, when there was no surplus to divide, whilst later on the surplus was sufficient only to permit of an annual redaction of a few cen- times per ton. It was unanimously agreed between all the French and foreign Directors of the Canal that the reduction of dues should operate each time the surplus allow- ed of a reduction of 50 centimes per ton, and not before."</p><p>“If the reduction of one or a fraction of a centime were made annually, the Com- pany," said the secretary, "would run the risk of being obliged in a bad year to reduce its dividend without being able to increase the Canal dues. Moreover the divi- sion of surplus profits is based on tho dm- dend at the moment of the last diminution of the toll."</p><p>“It was also promised on the ‘London pro- gramme,’ " pursued M. Bonnet, “that after the dividend on the shares should have reached 25 per cent., or 125 francs per share, the totality of the surplus profits should go towards the reduction of the Canal dues. That moment arrived quicker than was anticipated ; and, immediately the surplus profits allow of the reduction of the present toll of 8 francs 50 centimes per ton by 50 cen- times, the diminution will be effected. In the meantime the dividend has increased and will increase, and the further surplus profits, after each reduction of the toll by 50 cen- times, will, as heretofore, be calculated on the dividend declared simultaneously with the lowering of the toll. Till now this interpretation of the ‘London programme' has been uncon- tested, and it would evidently be impossible to get the shareholders of any oompany to accept the position of the certainty of no increase in their dividend with the possibility, and even the probability, of a reduction in their income owing to the fact of all the surplus profits being employed to reduce tolls which might, in the case of a period of prosperity being followed by one of commercial depression, have been brought down so low as to entail a very heavy lost to the share- holders."</p><p>“The next reduction of fifty centimes in the toll will take place," added M. Bonnot, “when the dividend on the share capital has reached one hundred and thirty-five francs. Each ten francs increase of the dividend will correspond for the future with a reduction of fifty centimes in the toll."</p><p>As to Sir Theodore Angior’s idea that the British directors should be appointed by the British shipowners, M. Bonnet pointed out to me what Prince d'Arenborg wrote some weeks ago, and he declared there could be no ques- tion of reversing that decision. The directors are, as in every company, selected by the board of directors, and their appointment is ratified by the shareholders at the general meeting.</p><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.1. </span><span class="head">THE EGYPTIAN SALT &amp; SODA COMPANY, LTD.</span></h3><p>NOTICE is hereby given, that an Extraor- dinary General Meeting of the Egyptian Salt &amp; Soda Company, Limited, will be held at the Registered Office of the Company, 6, Old Jewry, E.O., on the twelth day of January 1905 at 11 o'clock in the forenoon when the subjoined ex- traordinary and special resolutions will be pro posed.</p><p>Should the special resolution be passed by the required majority it will be submitted for confirmation as a special resolution to a second extraordinary meeting which will be held on the 27th January 1905, at 11 o’clock in the forenoon at the Registered Office of the Com- pany.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.2. </span><span class="head">SPECIAL RESOLUTION.</span></h3><p>That the Articles of Association be altered as follows namely :</p><p>a) In Article 34 the words “registered office or the Company’s offices in Cairo" shall be substituted for the word "office."</p><p>b) In Article 43 (-1-) after the words "except upon” add the words “a request of an allotte on an allotment of shares or upon."</p><p>c) 43 (4).

Sir A. Colvin (chairman of the company) presiding.</p><p>The Secretary (Mr. F. J. Horne) read the notice convening the meeting.</p><p>The Chairman: Gentlemen, you will, I presume, as usual, take the report as read. It is with much pleasure that we place in your hands such a satisfactory account of the past year, the results achieved having been, as you will see, excellent. And this notwithstanding the fact that the cattle plaque prevailed throughout the year, and that no mouleds or religions fairs were held. Whilst the increased average mileage worked has been less than one-third per cent, the increase in the gross receipts has been £30,483 on a total of £132,791 for 1903, or 23 per cent. Towards this our passenger traffic has contributed £14,389—nearly one-half—the numbers carried have gone up by 841,715 on a former total of 3,636,688, or nearly 23 per cent. The goods traffic also was very good, the receipts having gone up by £11,272, or over 20 per cent, the tons lifted showing a very large increase of 274,167 tons on a former total of 471,530. But of this 195,198 tons were for a special traffic in earth for reclaiming land by filling. This is entered under the head of “Manure," and ac- counts for the very large apparent increase under that head. The increase, therefore, under goods proper is some 79,000 tons—say, 17 percent—there being an increase under nearly every important item. There was a good cotton crop, and we carried 25,326 tons more, making a total of 136,375 tons of cotton moved, mostly loose, on a total last year of 111,049. The through bookings with the Slate Railway is steadily increasing, and this year amounted to 112,500 tons. The stone traffic at the El-Mounir and Abou Zabel quarries has made a fair start, and amounted to 8,667 tons, and as the condition of the country improves—the improvement year by year is very notable—better houses will be erected and more stone required for building them, so that we look for a steady develop- ment of this traffic to find employment for our goods stock in the slack season. In some very interesting articles in The Times last year on American railways and their working, it was stated that one of the principal freight agents of an important American system, on being asked what would be the charges for the carriage of some 15-ton lots a distance of 35 miles, replied :—"Oh, we don’t worry ourselves about such business as that We must carry most of our freight an average of 50 miles at least before we can consider that we have paid expenses I would rather carry from ten to forty tons of freight a distance of 1,500 miles for half a cent per ton per mile than I would carry it fifty miles for five cents per ton per mile.” We think our staff, therefore, deserve credit for the results achieved, when I tell you that the average load of all our goods traffic is only twelve miles with comparatively few consign- ments as large as 15 tons. We had about 300 miles of telegraph open at the end of the year, and earned £1,088, against an ex- penditure of £479. There is not much money in it, but it is a great convenience to our customers and in train working. Sundries also show a good increase of £4,610, due to hire of rolling stock for construction purposes, and to profits realised for the sale of reclaimed land. As regards our working charges, whilst the gross receipts have gone up by £30,483, of this increase only £8,857 has been spent on extra working, and this mainly on the addi- tional train mileage entailed by the growth of the passenger and goods traffic. This brings our ratio of working down to the satisfactory figure of 55.94 per cent against 62.12 last year. We trust that the traffic will steadily increase, and enable us to put this figure even somewhat lower; but on the other hand, we must remind you that as the line grows older the charges for maintenance and renewal of permanent way and rolling stock must increase. Well, gentlemen, when after meeting all charges for Debenture interest, putting by the sum of £11,046 for the sinking fund, and £2,834 for reserve, or a total ol £13,880, equivalent to 1.8 per cent on the Preference capital—although a considerable portion of that capital was unproductive owing to delays in getting sanction for works, in obtaining possession of land required, ant other causes-we found that we had sufficient to pay you a dividend of 5 per cent for the year without any material reduction of the amount brought forward from last year, to say nothing of having an appreciable reserve in hand, considering the short time we have been working, we thought that with favorable prospects for the current year before us we were fully justified in recommending for your approval that dividend.</p><p>Since the report was issued we have heard that Government have given their consent to the fusion of the Helouan Railway with that owned by the Delta Company, which has now been taken over and worked by us. As pointed out in the report, the concession for the Cairo Quarry lines has been completed, and we have now started work on them. For the reasons given in the report we have not during the year made as much progress as we could have wished with our extensions, having only opened some 17 miles ; since September 30th 6 miles more have been opened. The concession of the Province of Menoufieh is still delayed, pending the completion, presumably, of Government formalities, although we have done what we could during the past year to bring the matter to a close. We have also, sur- veyed some 130 miles of line, and carried out some improvements in the way of better stations, conversion of flag stations into permanent stations, lengthening of sidings, and such-like work necessitated by the growth of the traffic. Altogether we have expended some £141,000, of which £47,611 has been spent on rolling stock, we having put on the line twelve now 6-wheeled coupled engines which take excellent loads, 25 new bogie coach ing vehicles, 100 new bogie steel platform wag- ons, and since the close of the year 25 new bogie coaching vehicles and six more engines have been completed and are ready to go. With the growing extension and increasing traffic we must keep the line well supplied with stock, and more will be required immediately. Your , board is greatly indebted to the exertions and intelligent conduct of their affairs by their staff in Egypt,to all of whom, and especially to their agent. Captain Adams, RE., the acknowledg- ments of the company are largely due. I am glad to be able to add that throughout the year we have continued to maintain our customary excellent relations with the Egyptian Govern- ment authorities. I may mention that the ma- naging director and myself hope to be able to visit Egypt again this winter, to discuss various important points with the local board and the Government, and I trust our visits will con- tinue to be of the same use and advantage to the company as I venture to believe has hitherto shown itself the case, both as regards the Govern- ment and as enabling us personally to discuss with the local board, questions which require dis- , cussion on the spot, and of which the disposal is facilitated by such a direct exchange of views between your directors. With your permission I propose to deal first with the ordinary busi- ness of the meeting, and when that is disposed of to bring before you proposals for an increase of capital. I will, therefore, now move :— “That the report of the directors, dated November 30th, 1904, together with the state- , ment of accounts and balance-sheet for the year ended September 30th, 1904, be and they are hereby approved, confirmed and adopted.” Before putting the resolution to the vote I shall be very glad to answer any question that shareholders may wish to put to me, or give any information in my power.</p><p>The Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle seconded the resolution.</p><p>No questions bring asked, the resolution was put to the meeting and carried unan- imously.</p><p>The Chairman : Tho second resolution I have the honor to propose is : “That the interim dividend paid in June, 1904, be con- firmed, and that a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent per annum for the half-year ended September 30th, 1904, on the Preference share capital of the company be and here- by is declared to be paid to the share holders of the Preference shares standing on the registers of the company at Decem- ber 20th, 1904, and the holders of Preference share warrants to bearer."</p><p>Lieutenant-Colonel R L. Marryat, R E (managing director), seconded the resolution, and it was carried unanimously.</p><p>The Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle moved, “That Sir Auckland Colvin, one of the directors retir- ing in order of rotation, be re-elected"</p><p>This was seconded by Sir Francis L. O’Calla- ghan and carried unanimously.</p><p>he Chairman then moved the re-election of the Hon. Sir C. W- Fremantle, and, this having been seconded by Mr. Robert Miller, was carried unanimously.</p><p>On the motion of the Chairman, seconded by Mr. Montagu Sharpe, Maurice Cattaui Bey was also re-elected a director. </p><p>Mr. Alfred Wilkins moved the reappoint- ment of Messrs. Frank Davies, Meredith and Co as auditors.</p><p>Mr Benjamin Keable seconded the resolu- tion, and it was carried unanimously.</p><p>The Chairman : Gentlemen, I have now to bring before you our proposals for the increase of capital, the resolutions concerning which you will have seen on the hack of the report. We are not in immediate want of cash, as we probably have sufficient to carry us on for some months, but have come to the end of our powers of issue, and we desire to be in a posi- tion to be able to issue more capital as we require it, and to take advantage of a favorable money market, for, as you must be aware, that market of late years has not always been very favorable to fresh issues of capital. We there- fore ask you to create 39,460 new Preference shares, it being understood that we do not propose to issue the whole of this amount at once, as this would form far too heavy a strain on our current revenue, but only such amounts as we require from time to time and can reasonably expect to earn interest on without seriously affecting your dividends in any par- ticular year. I will, therefore, now move:— “That the capital of tho company be increased by the creation of 39,460 now Preference shares of the nominal amount of £10 each, and that such Preference shares be issued and allotted by the board upon such terms and conditions as they may determine, but such shares shall be issued upon the terms (subject to the powers of the board under Article 166 to set aside sinking funds and otherwise) that the surplus profits in each year after providing for a dividend on the amounts from time to time paid, or credited as paid, otherwise than in advance on all Preference shares at the rate of 5$ per cent for each year, shall be applied, first, in making up the arrears of dividend on the Preference shares of the company previously issued in respect of the period previous to the date of issue of the new Preference shares hereby authorised, and when those arrears have been paid, then in paying up the arrears (if any) which may sub- sequently accrue on all Preference shares in the order in which such arrears may have accrued, and thereafter the sum of 10s 9d per cent per annum on the said £394,600 of new capital as part of the sinking fund heretofore authorised in respect of the previous capital, so as to insure the repayment of the whole of the share capital authorised up to the date hereof in its due order of priority under the articles. Save as aforesaid, the said new Preference shares shall rank in all respects with the existing Preference shares of the company." </p><p>Sir C. W. Fremantle seconded the resolu- tion, and it was carried unanimously.</p><p>A shareholder asked if the chairman had anything to say with regard to the land com- pany as it affected this company.</p><p>The Chairman : The land company is still in an early stage. I think all that is to be said about it at present is that it is in the stage of inquiry and initial proceedings, but as far as we can see at present things are going on very favorably, and quite up to any expectations we could have. (Applause).</p><p>A vote of thanks was passed to the chair- man on the motion of Mr. J. H. Busby, seconded by Mr. Wilkins, and the proceedings terminated.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">5.3. </span><span class="head">SPORT AND PLAY</span><br /><span class="head">RACING.</span><br /><span class="head">HELOUAN FIRST WINTER MEETING.</span></h3><p>We congratulate the Helouan Sporting Club on the success of the races held on Saturday afternoon. Some of the causes which contribut- ed to their success—the weather, for example, and the air—could not, it is true, be assigned to the activity of the committee, but in all that concerned the arrangements on the course we noticed an enormous improvement on last year. The pari-mutuel is now behind the grand- stand, which bus been properly roofed and fitted up. The arrangements for supplying tea were capital, and the races began and ended as punctually as possible. There were many residents and visitors at the races ; we noticed among them H.H. Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, General Lance, C.B., Coles Pasha, Ishak Bey Hussein, Mr. Astley Friend, Saleh Bey Yaghen, Mr. Carter Wilson, Mr. Webb, Judge and Mrs. Satow, Capt. Herbert, Dr. and Mrs. Nolan, Dr. Bentley, Mr. Monteith- Smith, Mr. Aspinall, Major Davidson, Ibrahim Bey Cherif, Ahmed Bey Bakri Mr. Lockett, Ariz Pasha Izzet, Mr. Michaelides, and many others.</p><p>The chief feature of the racing was the success of Moharrem Pasha Chehin’s horses : two firsts, a second, and a third was a good record, and in the Sahara Stakes Bibico’s win was a very easy affair, and Aeolus was only caught in the last 100 yards by Kobelon Tair. The fourth race was a long way the best of the day, and Mizzaud lasting very well beat Shewiman, the favorite, by a little. In the fifth race Fil do Fer was a rather unex- pected winner. Roland’s effort in the third race was a little too late ; a hundred and fifty yards more, and he would probably have been third, it may be second.</p><p>CRITERION STAKES : of P.T. 2,500, 1st horse to receive P.T. 2,000, 2nd P.T. 300 and 3rd P.T. 200.

When the horses at last were ready the start was poor. Sayad II. and Togo led, but after the cutting Macdonald came up, only to give way to Rainbow, who passed Togo but could get nowhere near Sayad II., who won anyhow. Togo was third by 3/4 of a length. Time 1.27.</p><p>Totalisator paid P.T. 126 on winner. Places, 33, 44.</p><p>SAHARA STAKES, of P.T.13,000, 2nd horse to receive P.T.2,000, and 3rd horse P.T. 1,000 out of the stakes.

Elisea.</p><p>Firefly, which, with Roland, was a warm favorite, led at the start but at the cutting Bibico and Aeolus were ahead and simply riding away from the rest, who followed 4 or 5 lengths behind in a bunch. In the straight Sattam and Roland rushed up, and the former going very hard caught Aeolus and was second by half a length, Bibico winning without any undue exertion. Roland kept his effort till too late but was going very well at the finish.</p><p>Totalisator paid P.T. 41 on winner. Places 30, 47, 32.</p><p>DESERT HANDICAP, of P.T. 3,000, 1st horse to receive P.T.2,000, 2nd P.T.700, and 3rd P.T. 300. For Arab horses. Top-weight not to exceed 11 st. Distance 1 1/2 mile.

Michali.</p><p>After a moderate start Showiman led but Mizzaud and Royalist challenged him and at the first time round it was anyone’s race. Se- cond time round Mizzaud passed Royalist, all three horses still together but had to give way to Shewimon, who looked like winning on emerging from the cutting. Then came a splen- did race all the way home. Mizzaud came gra- dually up, got ahead in the straight and just got home by half a-length. Royalist was a good third but his jockey used whip too early.</p><p>Totalisator paid P.T.94 on winner, P.T.61 for place.</p><p>This race was followed by what appeared to be a private and informal sparring display between two well-known Egyptian owners of racing stables, which was not visible from the grand-stand.</p><p>TRIAL PLATE, of P.T. 2,500, 1st horse to receive P.T. 2,000, 2nd P.T. 300 and 3rd P.T. 200.
