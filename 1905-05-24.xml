                            <p>The well-known journalist Brailsford and the actor McCulloch were
                                charged at Bow street with conspiring to obtain a passport to Russia

                            <p>Paris, May 23.</p>

                            <p>The sculptor Paul Dubois is dead (Havas.)</p>

                            <p>Paul Dubois, who was one of the greatest of modern sculptures, was
                                born at Nogent-sur-Seine, July 18, 1829. He was destined by his
                                father for the legal profession, but his artistic tastes constrained
                                him to devote himself to sculpture, and he went to Paris to become
                                the pupil of the sculptor Toussaint, with whom he remained three
                                years. In 1859 he went to Italy, and in 1860 executed at Florence
                                the model for "St. John a Child," which was finished at Rome,
                                exhibited at the Salon of 1863, and is now at the Luxembourg,
                                together with “A Florentine Singer of the Fiftienth Century." This
                                last is in silvered bronze and thought its many reproductions in
                                smaller size has become very popular. Other works which may be cited
                                are the tomb of General'la Moriciere, one of the masterpieces of
                                modern statuary (1878), which is at Nantes; and busts of Bonnat,
                                Cabanel, Paul Baudry, Gounod, Pasteur (1890), and other celebrities.
                                M. Dubois also studied painting, and had executed nine portraits and
                                beautiful copies of old masters but was a very irregular contributor
                                to the Salon exhibitions. In 1873 he was appointed keeper of the
                                Luxembourg Museum, and director of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, May 30,
                                1878. Elected a member of the Academie des Beaux-Arts in 1876, he
                                was one of the Jury of Admission for the selection of sculpture at
                                the Exposition of 1878. He was a grand officer of the Legion of
                                Honour (1889). </p>

                            <head>MATTER NOW DROPPED.</head>

                            <p>London, May 23.</p>
                            <p>The scene in the House of Commons is without parallel in the history
                                of the House. The speakers, chiefly Mr Lyttelton, were greeted with
                                angry cries of "Bring in the Guards!” “Where are the police!” and by
                                the blowing of police whistles. After Mr. Austen Chamberlain and Mr.
                                Brodrick has sat down, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman again appealed
                                to Mr. Balfour declaring that by his silence he alone was
                                responsible for the disturbance. This renewed the uproar and Mr.
                                Balfour rose and severely rebuked the House for its unseemly
                                behaviour. Never in his experience had it refused to listen to a
                                Minister speaking for the Government, nor had the Opposition
                                presumed to dictate the order of speeches. To-night's precedent, if
                                followed, would absolutely ruin the Commons. Mr.Lyttelton again
                                rose, but the storm burst with redoubled fury. The Deputy Speaker
                                adjourned the House by virtue of the new rule reffering to a grave
                                disorder. The prolongation of the scene is attributed to the fact
                                that the Deputy-Speaker, who presided in consequence of the
                                Speaker's illness, has no power to suspend individual
                                Members.(Reuter.) </p>
                            <p>London, May 23.</p>
                            <p> House of Commons.- The House to-day was thronged, and Sir H.
                                Campbell Bannerman and Mr. Balfour were received with extraordinary
                                ovations on entering. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman asked whether in
                                view of the confusion created by the recent declarations of
                                Ministers with reference to the fiscal question and the Colonial
                                Conference, Mr. Balfour would fix a day for a vote of censure. Mr.
                                Balfour said that two Ministers were prepared to clear up any
                                confusion yesterday, when they wore prevented by the disgraceful
                                proceedings which Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman did nothing to prevent.
                                He had no objection to fixing a day provided he had an undertaking
                                that the debate would be conducted with ordinary de ceney and fair
                                play. The matter was then dropped. (Reuter.)</p>

                                performed by the Grand Rabbi of Alexandria. The wedding party
                                afterwards adjourned to the garden, which presented a most animated
                                spectacle. There were two buffets, one in the garden and the other
                                in the house. An orchestra played a charming selection of airs in
                                the garden and the guests did not leave until 8 o'clock. </p>

                                short time give a sufficient knowledge of the language of the

                            <p>The life-history of the worm is as follows : About the beginning of
                                June the moth lays eggs (about 300) on a leaf near the bottom of the
                                plant. These are easily soon on examination. The period of
                                incubation is from three to four days. The young worms begin to feed
                                on the leaf on which they are hatched. They grow very rapidly, and
                                in a few days spread over the entire plant. After feeding (from 18
                                to 22 days), the worms burrow into the soil, construct cells, and
                                pass the pupa stage (8 to 10 days). The moths then hatch out and
                                commence laying again. The whole life-history is thus from 30 to 40
                                days, depending to a certain extent on climatic conditions. In July,
                                therefore, we bare a second brood, followed by a thud in August,
                                after which the worms find food elsewhere. It is clear that the pest
                                can be most satisfactorily attacked by picking the leaves on which
                                the eggs are found. When the worms have spread over the plant, they
                                eat the young buds, flowers, leaves, &amp;c., and it is impossible
                                to do much. Fields have to be examined every few days when eggs are
                                being laid. It is evident that the more thoroughly the June brood is
                                kept in check, the less severe will subsequent generations be. </p>

                            <p>This morning, at about 10.30 ’o'clock, a serious outrage took place
                                in Mohamed Aly square, Alexandria, which resulted in grave injuries
                                to Ahmed Khalil, late consular janissary to the American consular
                                agency and at present bowab to St. Mark's Small Building. While the
                                man was on an errand and was walking through the square to collect
                                some money , an unknown person rushed up to him and folded him to
                                the ground with a sharp instrument,. evidently some iron weapon. His
                                upper lip was cut clean open and a gaping wound extends under the
                                nose. The aggressor at once made off, leaving his victim lying in a
                                pool of blood. The injured man has been taken to the Government
                                Hospital. He is quite unable to identify his would-be assassin, who
                                fortunately did not plunge the weapon far enough into the man's
                                mouth to inflict fatal injuries to the throat. It is strange that
                                such a bloodthirsty outrage could have been committed in Mohamed Aly
                                square, which was crowded with people, at that hour, and the
                                assassin have escaped scot free. </p>

                            <p>It appears that Yambio, the Nyam-Nyam chief, whose death we announced
                                in our Saturday’s issue, had been the mainstay of the whole revolt,
                                and that from the first his people wanted to come in, but were kept
                                back by him. He ruled his people with extreme severity, his only
                                punishment was death, and this was meted out frequently for the
                                slightest offence. Large numbers of women and girls were found
                                closely confined and jealously guarded in his village. All were
                                released and sent book to their villages whenever possible. Among
                                the trophies captured was the Sultan's great war drum. It stands
                                four feet high, is cut out of a single tree trunk, and is carved to
                                represent a buffalo. At Yambio's funeral there was no great display
                                of grief, and on this being pointed out by a British officer, an
                                Arab-speaking native answered “No ; they are not sorry, for if
                                Yambio had died a natural death and had been buried by his own
                                people, least 300 of them would have been slain at the same time.
                                "After establishing posts throughout the whole district, and
                                explaining the object of the Government, the remainder of the force
                                returned to Waw at the end of March. The expedition was an
                                unqualified success, and reflects great credit on Major Boulnois and
                                all the officers under his command. On the way back one of the
                                officers had rather a narrow escape. A leopard he had wounded badly
                                came straight for him, and though hit again in the neck, was not
                                finished off before it had bitten him deep in the arm and crunched
                                the right hand with its powerful jaws. </p>

                                Pasha's old station at Wadelai, on the left bank, in a fair state of

                            <p>Port Said, Tuesday. </p>
                            <p>Yesterday, for the second time during the past month, a certain house
                                situated in the Greek quarter, not for from the bazaar, caught fire.
                                The house if built of wood and was much damaged. No lives were lost
                                end the fire was extinguished without the assistance of the Fire
                                Brigade. There are many blocks of this class of wooden building in
                                Port Said, which were constructed soon after the opening of the
                                canal and arc now very unsafe and insanitary. </p>

                            <p>"Enquirer” writes:—I wish to understand the meaning of certain
                                excellent arrangements evidently formulated by the officials of the
                                Gouvernorst of Alexandria, but which appear to be words only, as no
                                one needs the instructions. I refer to the "writing on the wall"
                                here and there stating that "there is room here for a stand of 4
                                cabs and in others for 6, and so on." I have never yet found any
                                cabs taking up their positions on these legalized stands but
                                crawlers are still crawling and others place their carriages and
                                horses half across the end of a street so as to be seen down the
                                whole of it, to the great inconvenience of those turning into these
                                streets when the abuggies are begged to "kasskiss” and get out of
                                the way. In the early morning no cabs are to be found down the whole
                                length of Rosetta-road, which is a long one, and this is a great
                                inconvenience to people who do not keep their own carriages. The
                                same thing occurs late in the evening. If the “writing on the wall"
                                has any in it why are there instructions treated as null and void.

                    <head>THE SULTAN'S DANGER,</head>

                    <head>THE REVOLT IN YEMEN.</head>

                    <p>The revolt of Southern Arabia against the Sultan may prove to be an event of
                        much more than local importance. The eastern shores of the Red Sea are to
                        little frequented by Europeans that it is only on rare occasions that any
                        news from the vast tracts of country which were known to the Romans as
                        Arabia Felix reaches the outside world. Running from north to South, the
                        three divisions of territory known as the Hedjaz, the Azir, and the Yemen
                        are nominally provinces of the Turkish Empire, though Turkish rule has never
                        effectively penetrated into the less accessible mountain districts. The
                        Hedjaz is by far the most important of those divisions, for it contains the
                        holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the possession of which is the visible
                        proof to the Mahomedan world of the Sultan’s title to be regarded as Caliph.
                        The Azir is the wildest and the most inhospitable of these regions, and is
                        peopled largely by tribes which adhere to the doctrines of the Shia sect,
                        and consequently repudiate altogether the claim of a Sunnite Sultan to
                        spiritual supremacy. The Shia doctrine is also widely held in the Yemen,
                        which, owing to the fertility of its mountain valleys and the comparative
                        excellence of its climate, is economically a possession of considerable
                        importance. This fertility has attracted settlers from the earliest times,
                        and the Yemen can show traces of a very remarkable civilisation, believed by
                        some to Ira coeval with that of ancient Egypt. The Yemen, from its
                        geographical position, was one of the new forces which were born into the
                        world with Mahomed, and many of the Imams, the semiecclesiastical,
                        semi-civil rulers, who for centuries exercised an uncertain sway over the
                        Arab tribes which peopled it, were of the blood of the Prophet. The Turkish
                        power was first effectually established in the country in the reign of
                        Suleiman tho Magnificent, and by the middle of the sixteenth century all the
                        coast of Arabia acknowledged the Turkish rule, and Sanaa became the seat of
                        the Pasha of Yemen. The Turkish occupation came to an end in 1630, and one
                        Kasim, a descendant of the Prophet, founded a line of Imams which continued
                        in power for more than two centuries, until the lawless state of the
                        country, which rendered caravan trade impossible, induced the Turks to
                        reoccupy the country and restore the direct rule of the Porte in 1872. The
                        Yemen, however, has proved no bed of roses to the Turks during the last
                        thirty years. The prevalence of the Shia doctrine, which makes the rule of a
                        Sunnite Sovereign highly repugnant to the Arab trioesinen, the spirit of
                        independence which characterises mountaineers all the word over, and the
                        incompetence and rapacity of the Turkish officials have all militated
                        against the establishment of a lasting peace. A dangerous revolt broke out
                        in 1892, and the existence of a representative of the ancient Imams, in the
                        shape of Ahmed ed-Din, who, however, does not appear to have been very
                        anxious to play the part of national hero, gave it the character of a
                        religious war. The Porte, by a lavish expenditure of men and money, managed
                        to scotch the rebellion, but the embers of disaffection have continued to
                        smoulder, and at no time has the Yemen been completely free from
                        trouble.</p>

                    <p>The proximate cause of the present outbreak is not clear, though the German
                        semi-official Press, by the way, has already satisfied itself that it is due
                        to a deep-laid scheme on the part of the British Government to prepare the
                        way for the establishment of British supremacy in the Arabian peninsula.
                        Putting aside this ingenious fabrication, which is probably intended chiefly
                        for consumption in Constantinople, we can entertain no doubt as to the
                        serious proportions to which the rising has attained. News reached this
                        country at the end of February that the whole country south of Sanaa was in
                        a state of insurrection, and that the towns of Kataba and Tais had already
                        fallen into the hands of the insurgents Ominous reports began to arrive of
                        wholesale desertion from the Turkish ranks, and, though the town of Sanaa
                        held out stubbornly for a time, Ali Riza Pasha, who attempted to relieve it
                        with seven battalions of infantry and a battery of artillery, only succeeded
                        in entering the town with the loss of his guns and a large portion of his
                        force. A few days afterwards, on April 30, the town surrendered to the
                        insurgents, whose booty included thirty - guns and 20,000 rifles, with a
                        considerable quantity of ammunition. So far we have beard nothing of any
                        attempt to proclaim an Imam; but, if it is true that Mahmud Yahya, who is
                        described as the principal Sheikh of Yemen, has arrived in Constantinople to
                        submit to the Government certain proposals for the autonomy of the Yemen in
                        return tor the payment of an annual tribute, it is clear that the insurgents
                        will not be content with the mere redress of abuses or the dismissal of
                        unpopular officials.</p>

                    <p>The Ottoman Government appears to be doing its best to hurry troops and
                        stores down to Hodeida, but the Syrian reinforcements which have already
                        arrived have proved unsatisfactory, and the attempt to mobilise Redif
                        battalions in Albania has been attended with great difficulties. Drafts are
                        also being sent from the Adrianople command, and orders have been given for
                        the calling out of a division of the Angora Re Ids, whose headquarters are
                        in Constantipole. Rita Pasha, who is either killed or a prisoner, has been
                        succeeded in the command by Marshal Ahmed Fevzi Pasha. The secession of the
                        Yemen, if carried out, would be a very serious blow to the Turkish power ;
                        for the ridings of a successful revolt could not fail to spread to the Azir
                        and the Hedjsz, and might raise throughout the Arabian peninsula the racial
                        fanaticism of all the bribes whose traditional hatred of the Turk has never
                        been curbed except by fear. Even in modern times the Wahabi movement has
                        shown how sudden end overwhelming such outbreaks are apt to be amongst the
                        fierce tribesmen of Arabia. Less than a hundred years ago, Mecca and Medina
                        themselves fell into the hands of the Arab Puritans, and were wrested from
                        them only by the military intervention of Egypt under Mohamed Ali. Happily
                        for Egypt, Egyptian troops are no longer at the beck and call of the Sultan.
                        The magnitude of the military preparations ordered by Abdul Hamid gives,
                        however, the measure of the anxiety into which events in the Yemen have
                        plunged tho Imperial mind. A general uprising in Arabia is not, perhaps, a
                        likely contingency, but it does not need any very intimate acquaintance with
                        the workings of the Mahomedan mind to be able to form an estimate of the far
                        reaching effects upon the position of the Sultab as a factor in
                        international politics if he were ultimately to lose his bold over the
                        cradle of Islam. (The Times).</p>

                    <head>THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL.</head>

                    <p>A largely attended meeting was held in the great hail of the Church House,
                        Loudon, last week by the Women's Union of the Church of England Temperance
                        Society. Canon J. W. Horsley presided. At this mooting an address was given
                        by Sir Frederick Treves on "The physical effects of the use of alcohol,"
                        which should prove of much interest in this country, owing to the prominence
                        given to the drink question of late-especially by the remarks made by Lord
                        Cromer. The hands of all temperance reformers ought to be greatly
                        strengthened by such a speech as the following. </p>
                    <p>Sir Frederick Treves in his address said that alcohol was, of course,
                        distinctly a poison. It had certain uses, like other poisons, but the
                        limitations on its use should be as strict as on argenic, opium, and
                        strychnia. It was a curiously insidious poison, producing effects which
                        seemed to be only relieved by taking more of it a remark which applied to
                        another insidious poison, morphia, or opium. It had a certain position as
                        medicine, but in the last 25 years its use by the medical profession had
                        steadily and emphatically diminished. People were often heard to say that
                        alcohol was an excellent appetiser when taken before meals. But the appetite
                        did not need artificial stimulation; if the body wanted feeding it demanded
                        food. As for its "aiding digestion," it hindered digestion even when taken
                        in small amounts, as could be easily demonstrated. Then there was the idea
                        that alcohol was strengthening. As a fact, it curiously modified the
                        nourishment of the body ; it greatly lessened the output of carbonic acid—a
                        very important matter—so that the drunkard was necessarily aa ill-nourished
                        man ; and to reach the acme of physical condition was impossible if any
                        alcohol was used. Its stimulating effect was only momentary, and after that
                        had passed off the capacity for work fell enormously. Alcohol, as it were,
                        brought up the whole of the reserve forces of the body and threw them into
                        action, and when those were used up there was nothing to fall back on. It
                        dissipated rather than conserved bodily energy. As a work producer it was
                        exceedingly extravagant, and might lead to a physical bankruptcy ; and he
                        was not speaking, he would remind them, excessive drinking. It was a curious
                        fact that troops could not march on alcohol. In the Ladysmith relief column,
                        which he accompanied, the first men to drop out were simply the men who
                        drank. The fact was as clear as if they had all borne labels on their backs.
                        As for the statement that alcohol was "a great thing, for the circulation"
                        it increased the heart-beat and reddened the skin by using up the body’s
                        reserve power, but then the heart’s action became emphatically weaker, a
                        temporary effect being got at an enormous cost. The action of alcohol on the
                        central nervous system was very definite, and was that of a functional
                        poison, first stimulating and then depressing the nervous system. The higher
                        nervous centres went first, becoming slightly dulled. The mar who worked on
                        even a moderate amount of alcohol was not at his best. Fine work could not
                        be done under that condition. The use of alcohol was absolutely inconsistent
                        with a surgeon’s work, or with any work demanding quick and alert judgment.
                        He was much struck by the number of professional men who for this reason had
                        discontinued the use of alcohol in the middle of the day. The last notion he
                        would refer to was that alcohol kept out the cold—that a "little nip” was
                        good when going out into cold air, and so forth. In the words of a great
                        authority, alcohol really lowered the temperature of the body by increased
                        loss of beat and to some extent by increased oxidation, and much reduced the
                        power of the body to resist cold. Finally, he would say that the great and
                        laudable ambition of all, and especially of young men, to be "fit” could not
                        possibly be achieved if they took alcohol. It was simply preposterous to
                        suppose that any young healthy person needed any alcohol whatever; and,
                        indeed, he was much better without even the smallest amount of it. Having
                        spent the greater part of his life operating, he would say, with Six James
                        Paget, that of all people those he dreaded to operate on were the drinkers.
                        He hoped that what he had said would help his bearers to answer such
                        absolute fallacies as "a glass of port can do you no harm."</p>

                    <p>Mr. W. Joynson-Hicks afterwards spoke on the economic aspects of the
                        temperance question, and Canon Horsley on the spiritual side of the work.

                        <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir,—I should be glad to know through the medium of your paper what
                            is the obejection on the part of the Municipality to the forming of a
                            good driving road round the eastern harbour. In civilised countries the
                            roads are made first and then houses. The rule hitherto in Egypt
                            generally has been the contrary. Property at once goes up in value when
                            good roads have been made. The plans for the building allotments, I
                            hear, are all drawn up and to be seen at the Municipality, and I
                            therefore suggest that the esplanade should be taken in hand at once to
                            enable people at any rate to drive round to Ras-el-Tin by an airy and
                            pleasant route instead of through the smelly slum which up to now has
                            been the only way for Ministers attending Councils at the Palace,
                            Consuls paying official calls on board men-of-war, and for all those who
                            attend receptions at Ras-el-Tin (to say nothing of the frequenters of
                            the Yacht Club), to arrive at their destination. In the name of
                            commonsense let us have the enjoyment of this new outlet after all the
                            public money that has been spent on improvements which may be carried
                            out when the mish-mish are ripe, and most of us dead and buried. As I
                            said above in Europe roads come before houses.—Faithfully yours, Common

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette: Sir I beg to call your attention
                            to the extreme carelessness of the man employed at the level crossing on
                            the Pyramids road. On several occasions, notwithstanding the new
                            regulating bell, which announces the approach of the train, the gates
                            have barely been closed before the train rushed past To- day (May 20)
                            about 5.30, if it had not been for the intelligence of a small child,
                            who woke the sleeping attendant, the train would have passed the
                            crossing at full speed with all the gates wide open! As it was there was
                            only time to close one pair of gates. It is hardly necessary to point
                            out how serious a danger this is to the public on such a frequented road
                            as that of the Pyramids.</p>

                        <p>I may also state that the driver of the passenger train failed to sound
                            the whistle, which he should do according to the rules, on nearing a
                            level crossing. I enclose my card, and remain, Sir, etc., Pro Bono

                    <head>THE EGYPTO-HELLENIC CONVENTION</head>

                    <p>The negotiations in regard to the terms of the new commercial convention
                        between Egypt and Greece have not yet armed at any definite hasis. The
                        Egyptian Government insists on the prohibition of hashish cultivation in
                        Greece, but the Hellenic Government demurs to this concession, as the
                        cultivation of hashish is one of the thief resources of the central plateau
                        of the Peloponnesus. The attitude of the Egyptian Government in this matter
                        is alluded to in the following terms in Lord Cromer's Report:-</p>

                    <p>In the course of last year, the Egyptian Government denounced tho Commercial
                        Convention with Greece. The terms of a new Convention are now under
                        discussion. It is of great importance in Egyptian interests that the
                        importation of hashish should be stopped, and also that greater facilities
                        should be accorded to the police to deal with smugglers and keepers of
                        disorderly houses, of whom a large number are Greek subjects.</p>

                    <p>The "Messager d'Athenes" remarks as follows:-</p>

                    <p>(XXXXX) parait que le gouvernement bellenique pourrait tout au plus prendre
                        l'engagement de restreindre la culture de cette plante que l'on introduit en
                        contrebande en pays musulmans et surtout en Egypte.</p>

                    <p>The spread of hashish smoking among the inhabitants of Athens and the Piraeus
                        must sooner or later force the Hellenic Government in the interests of its
                        own people to come round to the standpoint of the Egyptian Government. In
                        regard to the baneful effects of the drug, it is worth noting that the
                        number of persons, whose insanity is due to the use of hashish, admitted to
                        the lunatic asylum at Abbassieh, has been steadily decreasing ol late years.
                        In 1897, these constituded 33 per cent. Of the total number of male
                        patients. In 1904, out of 350 male patients, only 53, or about 15 per cent,
                        were insane owing to the use of hashish. But these figures cannot be
                        considered as conclusive evidence that the use of hashish is decreasing. The
                        diminution may tie, and perhaps is, due to the fact that, by reason of the
                        very limited accommodation available at the asylum, instructions have been
                        issued to the local doctors only to send the worst cases to Abbassieh. Thus,
                        out of 208 cases of insanity from all causes, admitted into the Alexandria
                        Hospital during the past year, only 37 were sent to Abbassieh. The campaign
                        against the use of the drug continues, but, except in, so far as its result
                        is to raise the price, which is now as high as 50 fr. a kilog., it cannot be
                        said to be very successful. There is a considerable demand for the drug. The
                        individual consumer is not very greatly affected by the rise in price. A
                        large number of low class Europeans and Egyptians find the wholesale and
                        retail trade very lucrative. The Coastguard, Customs, and Police seized
                        21,369 kilog. of hashish in the course of last year. This was about 3,000
                        kilog. less than in 1903. The diminution is mainly due to the fact that
                        formerly the greater portion of the hashish brought into Egypt came from
                        Tripoli along the coast to Alexandria. It is now landed in Tripoli, thence
                        carried south to the Oasis of Baharieh siid Dakhleh, and so into Egypt. The
                        change of route enhances the difficulty of capture. The case is, in many
                        respects, the same as that of the Slave Trade. So long as the demand and the
                        supply exist, it is almost impossible to prevent evasions of the law; no
                        sooner is one route closed to the smuggler, than another is opened up. The
                        difficulties of the Coastguard and the Customs with regard to the smugglers,
                        and those of the police with regard to retailers and consumers, are obvious.
                        It is difficult to do very much more than we already do in Egypt What is
                        wanted is that Greece should prohibit die cultivation of hashish. In this,
                        as in some other instances, the regime of the Capitulations tends to the
                        demoralisation of the country. At the same time, a'recent change in the law,
                        under which tenants of cafes, &amp;c, sentenced to be permanently closed,
                        can no longer frustrate the ends of justice by putting forward others as
                        nominal holders, has somewhat strengthened the hands of the police.</p>

                    <head>A STATUETTE OF ISIS.</head>

                    <p>For the purpose of its being included in the Corpus of Semitic Inscriptions,
                        M. Gaston Maspero forwarded to Paris a photograph of a statuette of Isis
                        having a Phoenician inscription. The figure is of the ordinary Egyptian type
                        of the goddess, with the infant Horus upon her lap, and it may be seen by
                        visitors to the Cairo Museum. The Phoenician text, as read by M. Clermont
                        Gannesu, is as follows "Gertsaphon son of 'Azer, son of Chalcat...to his
                        mistress Achtoret” The text proves that the donor of the statuette
                        identified Isis with the Syrian Achtoret, whom we know, on the other side,
                        was closely connected with the Bsbylonian Ishtar. The style of the statuette
                        and paleographical character of the inscription indicate early in the 4th
                        century B.C. as the date of its manufacture.</p>

                    <head>OFFICIALS' INDEBTEDNESS.</head>

                    <p>A correspondent writes —Although repeated references to the present trade
                        crisis have not, so far as I know, led to a formal Government enquiry, they
                        appear to have caused, many independent enquiries to be made, and from a
                        number of communications received I gather that the present “trade financial
                        crisis" is to a great extent caused by the evil efforts or traders of a
                        Khedivial decree promulgated during the last Ministry of Riaz Pasha, with
                        the approval of Lord Cromer, depriving creditors of the right established by
                        the laws of the country (and very freely used up till then) to lay or levy
                        claims for debts against the salary of any employe of the Egyptian
                        Government.</p>

                    <p>When this decree became law the indebtedness to local tradespeople of
                        Government employes was very considerable, and it kept on increasing, until
                        it now amoun's to a sum estimated at over a million sterling. The trader, on
                        the one hand, being able to take any step with a view to its recovery, the
                        Government employs, on the other, feels perfectly secure from oven the risk
                        of his indebtedness becoming known to his chief. It is from the date of this
                        decree that traders have found it necessary to demand the long credits for
                        which Egypt has now become famous in the manufacturing centres of
                        Europe.</p>

                    <p>It causes no little surprise in commercial circles that Lord Cromer should
                        hare given his approval to such a law—knowing as he must how it was likely
                        to be abused in a country like this—more especially at the present moment,
                        when he recommends a revision of the Capitulations, while he keeps in force
                        a decree which, to say the least of it, affords undue protection to the
                        Government employe, as it protects him from the usual liability to be called
                        upon to pay his just debts, etc. For full evidence of its evil effects on
                        traders we have only to refer to the official daily records of the Mixed
                        Tribunals, where failures are the order of the day.</p>

                    <head>THE MAID OF HONOR</head>

                    <head>A PLEASANT GLIMPSE OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA.</head>

                    <p>The Court lady of old days, says Lady Violet Greville, in the "New York
                        Tribune," was merely a superior kind of servant ; the Maid of Honor of
                        to-day is a charming, accomplished girl whose duty is to make herself
                        pleasant to the guests and talk agreeably to the important personages who
                        may be visiting at the castle. She should be a good linguist, have read the
                        most talked-of books of the day, and possess musical tastes. She is expected
                        to take a hand at bridge, if required to make up a rubber ; but she must not
                        play for money, as the Queen disapproves of girls gambling or playing for
                        larger stakes than they can well afford. Smoking cigarettes, too, which is
                        such a modern craze, is discountenanced by the Queen.</p>

                    <p>The life of a Maid of Honor is an interesting one: she is brought in contact
                        with all sorts of illustrious people ; she constahtly meets celebrities; she
                        hears talk on all kinds of subjects ; she receives in fact a most
                        cosmopolitan education—the education that makes a wise woman of the world.
                        She learns tact, sense, courtesy, and becomes infinitely adaptable. Court
                        life being so much simpler than in the past, it also has become more human
                        and more real. Much precious time no longer is wasted in idle etiquette or
                        the trivial gossip and petty jangling and scandal mongering of a superior
                        housekeeper’s room, of which we get such vivid glimpses in the d’Arblay
                        Memoirs.</p>

                    <p>A delightful story is told of Queen Alexandra, which exhibits the pleasant
                        relations existing between her and her Maids of Honor. On one occasion one
                        of the young women arrived at the castle minus her luggage, and quietly
                        informed her Majesty of the fact. The Queen, instead of reproving her for
                        carelessness, merely remarked : “My dear child, how did you manage it? I
                        never lose mine."</p>

                    <head>AUSTRIA AND MONTENEGRO.</head>

                    <p>It is significant of the armed neutrality which has existed between
                        Montenegro and Austria- Hungary since the occupation of Bosnia and
                        Herzegovina by the latter after the Berlin Congress, that no treaty of
                        commerce has ever been drawn up between the two countries. This is owing to
                        no backwardness on the part of Montenegro, for as soon as his State was
                        actually independent of Turkish control Prince Nicolas made a point of
                        entering into treaties with the Powers of Europe, and that between Great
                        Britain and Montenegro was drawn up as far back as 1881. At present, Mr.
                        Moisanovich, the Montenegrin Minister of Finance, is in Vienna, negotiating
                        with Herr Call, the Austrian Minister of Commerce, on the subject of the
                        conclusion of a treaty. The want of a commercial convention is very
                        prejudicial to the little mountain principality, as its goods are very
                        heavily taxed by the Austro-Hungarian Custom House. But, on the other hand,
                        the present position of affairs gives rise to an immense amount of smuggling
                        across the frontier, with the result that “untoward incidents" are always
                        owning between the smugglers and the Austrian Custom House guards. The
                        frontier is an extremely difficult one to watch, and the Montenegrins are
                        always ready for a fight. The consequence is that however friendly Vienna
                        and Cettigne may be, relations on the border are very strained. But a
                        commercial treaty will do away with the tension which at present exists.</p>

                    <head>NEW HOSPITAL TO BE BUILT.</head>

                    <head>SITE AT HADRA SELECTED.</head>

                    <p>In view of the present movement in favor of the establishment of a British
                        cottage hospital or nursing home at Alexandria, special interest is attached
                        to the report on the work of the Deaconesses’ Hospital in our city for the
                        year 1904, which has just been issued. The committee, in their report, state
                        that last year they were preoccupied with the question of removing the
                        hospital to another site. The necessity for this imposed itself on them
                        owing to the fact that the lands contiguous to the hospital are now covered
                        with houses inhabited by a very dense population. Again, the removal of the
                        isolation ward for contagious diseases had become an urgent matter. It not
                        haying been found suitable to build on the only piece of vacant ground in
                        the immediate vicinity, the committee decided to dispose of the present site
                        and acquire another, of a more suitable character. They selected a large
                        piece of ground at Hadra, opposite the new prison, and favorable terms
                        having been obtained from the Government, the purchase was concluded. As
                        soon as a satisfactory offer can be obtained for the actual site of the
                        hospital, the construction of the new building will be begun. In the
                        meantime, several improvements and additions have been made to the present
                        premises to meet urgent requirements. It is very regrettable, however, say
                        the committee, that in making the now operating-theatres, the major portion
                        of the rooms formerly need as a polyclinique had to be taken, and the latter
                        was consequently closed. Statistics showed that 9,627 patients only were
                        treated in the polyclinique in 1904, as against 24,562 in 1903. To allow of
                        this work—which is of great benefit, especially to the native
                        population-being carried on, therefore, a kiosk was erected in the
                        north-east corner of the garden. For some time past, the report continues,
                        the necessity has been felt of cresting another isolation ward for serious
                        contagious maladies, such as smallpox, etc., and it was decided to establish
                        this ward as conveniently as possible.</p>

                    <p>Coming to the statistical portion of the report, we find that during last
                        year, 1,606 patients (including 91 remaining over from the previous year)
                        were treated in the hospital. This was the largest number on record, the
                        next highest figure being reached in 1903, when 1,624 patients received
                        treatment. Of the total last year, 1,177 were men (170 of them Bailors), 346
                        women, and 83 children. 1,191 left the hospital cured, 178 got better, 70
                        were discharged as incurable, and 73 died, leaving 94 under treatment at
                        December 31. Classed according to their religious beliefs, 266 were
                        Protestants, 264 Roman Catholics, 3 Greek Catholics, 79 Greek Orthodox, 51
                        Copts, 63 Armenian Orthodox, 17 Maronites, 36 Jews, 836 Moslems, and 1
                        Theosophite. These represented no less than 21 different nationalities.
                        Among Europeans, the British predominated, there having been 195 British
                        subjects in hospital during the year (128 are classed as “English" and 72
                        from British possessions). The next largest number of Europeans treated were
                        Germans, viz., 115. Of Americans there were 12. On an average, 94 beds were
                        oocupied per day during the year. 45 patients occupied first-class rooms,
                        270 were in the second-class, and 1,291 in the wards. Only three Englishmen
                        were treated gratuitously during the year, while 49 Germans received free
                        treatment.</p>

                    <p>The receipts of the hospital during 1904 amounted to P.T. 120,429 and the
                        expendi- ture P.T. 339,671. The rooeipts included a subvention from the
                        British Government (for 1903) of P.T. 4,875, from the German Government of
                        P.T. 2,925, from the Swiss Government of P.T. 775, and from the Alexandria
                        Municipality of P.T. 5,000. The subscriptions amounted to £194. A large
                        number of gifts were received during the year, including one of a complete
                        Routgen Ray apparatus from Mrs. Bindernagel.</p>

                    <head>CROPS AND WEATHER</head>

                    <p>(From Our Correspondent).</p>

                    <p>Cyprus, May 16.</p>

                    <p>Reports from various parts of the Island show that considerable damage was
                        done to crops by the severe hailstorms at the end of April. The barley
                        suffered perhaps the most, but oats, vines, potatoes, and certain fruit
                        trees were also injured to some extent. The weather for the last week has
                        been hot, though not unpleasantly so.</p>

                    <p>LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</p>

                    <p>The Legislative Council reassembled on the 17th instant, having adjourned on
                        20th ult.</p>

                    <p>SUMMER RESORT FOR EGYPTIANS.</p>

                    <p>It is believed that several Anglo Egyptum officials and their familiar
                        contemplate visiting Mt. Troodos during tbe summer-season. It is certainly a
                        delightful and most healthy place during the hot months. It is, however,
                        very necessary that intending visitors should make their arrangements
                        beforehand as to camping, as the accommodation is very limited and the only
                        “huts", are allotted to Cyprus Government officials. A small hotel was
                        opened last year by Mr. Selim Houry, of Limassol, and I believe that one is
                        to be started this year by Mr. Majous Houry, of Limassol. There has been a
                        rather larger number of visitors to the Island than usual during the winter,
                        and several intend remaining until the autumn.</p>

                    <p>RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT.</p>

                    <p>Col. the Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E., and his brother arrived on a visit from
                        Egypt last month, and on the 27th April Mr. Shelford, the Consulting
                        Engineer for the Cyprus Railway, came to inspect the work so far completed.
                        The construction of the railway proceeds steadily, the railhead being now
                        within a few miles of Angastina, a distance of about 22 miles from the
                        terminus.</p>

                    <p>REAPING MACHINES.</p>

                    <p>There has been a greater demand than usual for reaping machines this season,
                        and it is hoped that the native agriculturists are now coming to recognise
                        their utility.</p>

                    <p>EGYPT AND CYPRUS MAIL </p>
                    <p>The existing mail contract with Bell’s Steamship Line terminates in June
                        next, and much interest is felt in regard to the new arrangements that may
                        be made for carrying the mail between Egypt and Cyprus.</p>
