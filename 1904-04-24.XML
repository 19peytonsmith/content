<head>The Heat of Saturday.</head><p>—The recent heat wave, which, fortunately, was of short duration, was greatly felt in Alexandria, where on Saturday the registered shade temperature reached 38 deg. Centigrade, or a shade over 100 deg. Fahrenheit. The night of Saturday was an exceedingly oppressive one, and at half-past nine o’clock an outdoor temperature of 91 deg. was registered, while indoors the thermometer stood at 77, necessitating a reversal of the usual practice of opening the windows to obtain a breath of fresh air. The temperature in other parts of Egypt may be seen by reference to our daily weather report. Compared with Cairo and many places in Upper Egypt, the heat was in proportion more excessive in Alexandria.</p>

<head>Carlton Hotel, Bulkeley.</head><p> — Some time ago we announced that owing to the continual influx of visitors applying for accommodation at this fashionable hotel, which in many cases has to be refused on account of the limited number of rooms, the proprietor, Mr. Aquilina, intended to add to the building either another floor or two wings, in which way 20 more rooms will be obtained. There is also to be added a new and spacious dining-room capable of seating comfortably from 50 to 60 guests. We understand that those improvements are shortly to be taken in hand, and that precautions will be taken for the work to be done without any inconvenience being caused to either the visitors or the service. The hotel is open all the year round, and it is just as full during the tourist season as it is during the summer months.</p>

<head>CAIRO WATER COMPANY.</head>
<p>A Cairo correspondent writes:— The indifference of the Cairo Water Company during the heat wave we have had for the last four days deserves to be made public. At 5 p.m. to-day (Saturday) I rang up the company informing them that the supply to my house had been cut off  since 10 a.m. The prompt but calm reply was, “Vous n'etes pas le seul.",.. “(Cesta cause des tortes chaleurs.” Nor was there a promise of our quarter getting water soon... "peut-etre peudant la nuit; ou demain matin." Under the circumstances, it was hopeless to appeal to such utter indifference. I bad not bad any ice for three days either, although I had written and telephoned to the Ice Company. I therefore went in person to the Ice Company’s office, but I soon realised the situation when I saw the number of idle carts and men waiting with empty bags. The situation was still more strongly impressed upon me when I heard the telephone messages. Finally, when I got a hearing, the reply was, ‘ Monsieur ; e'est la laute de la Cie des Eaux" etc. I did not stay there much longer; the air was too hot all round.</p></div>

<head>BANDMANN OPERA COMPANY.
‘‘A COUNTRY GIRL."</head>
<p>Saturday night was torrid : the khamseen blew as vigorously as ever and the collapse of some of the actors and many of the audience would have astonished no one. None the less the Khedivial Opera House at Cairo was crowded, and the actors and actresses survived a terrific heat and an inconsiderate number of encores, though it would be carrying compliment too for to say that none of the voices remained unaffected by the heat, especially towards the end of the first act.</p>
<p>“A Country Girl” is perhaps the weakest of recent Edwardesian musical plays. The plot is naively simple, and the music, while including a few catchy airs, is of no particular merit, and as the piece was written for a group of well-known actors and actresses,— we need only mention Mr. Huntley Wright, Mr. Rutland Barrington, and Miss Evie Green,— it is obvious that it can only be made a success by sheer “ go ’’ on the part of the performers. Given the requisite amount of vigour and voice on their part, good staging and pretty dresses, the most childishly simple piece will attain a considerable success, and if critics urge that the music or the plot or both are weak, the answer is obvious. The Englishman as a rule regards theatre-going as a sedative: he wants to hear something that will allay and not stimulate thought, and in the meantime please his eye and tickle his humour, and for such purpose the “musical comedy" is a most effective weapon. It follows that in the average musical comedy— we are not discussing Gilbert and Sullivan— the acting is everything, and the actors who make the piece a success are paid the sincere compliment of painstaking and often successful imitation by all who follow them. The brief life of such pieces, and the fact that a popular favorite sets the fashion, make it hopeless to expect an original reading of a part, and with this we have no quarrel; all of us have not the chance hearing Miss Erie Greene or Mr. Rutland Barrington in their latest successes, but when a good travelling company visits us, we have at least the satisfaction of watching a good imitation of their methods.</p>
<p>So on Saturday night Mr. Sinclair Cotter, modelling his style on that of Mr. Huntley Wright, kept the house hugely amused, showed an activity with the thermometer at 94 % that would have done credit to one who had spent a lifetime under the Equator, and responded to encores which were really heartless with the utmost good nature and readiness. Mr. Lester, as the Rajah of Bhong, had evidently watched Mr. Rutland Barrington, and Mr. B. Roberts gave a capital rendering of Sir Joseph Verity. Geoffrey Chaltoner's part does not give much scope for action; no doubt Mr. O’Connor did his best and his singing was decidedly good; his voice carries well, and he never let himself go at the wrong moment. Miss Corlass and Miss Carkeeh were both a little out of voice at the start, and the same remark applies to Miss Marie Elba (The Princess), but there was every excuse for that, and they acted and looked well, especially Miss Corlass, whose enunciation, by the way, was particularly clear and graceful Miss Morra (Mme. Sophie) also made a very pleasant impression on the audience, and her "Chicken Dance" with Barry was capitally done. Before we end these notes we must not forget to mention that “Lady Anchestor,” whose name we cannot find on the programme, sang us “Scenes that are brightest," an interpolation from Maritana, and sang it charmingly.</p></div>

<head>EASTER DAY SERVICES.
ALL-SAINTS’ CHURCH, CAIRO.</head>
<p>The five services on Easter Day at All Saints’ Church, Cairo, were well attended. The clergy who officiated were Very Rev. Dean Batcher, D.D., Rev. Thompson Burns, Rev. Reunie Macinnes, and Rev. Temple Gairdner. Dean Batcher preached at both morning and evening services, taking his text in the morning from Matthew 28.6 “For He is risen.” There were 258 communicants. The music was excellent. Indeed, Mr. Peacock's well drilled choir have rarely been heard to greater advantage. Barnby's anthem “Awoke my glory,” was beautifully rendered, and the familiar Easter hymns were well sung by the choir and heartily joined in by the congregation. The church was decorated with palms, and the altar and lectern were ornamented with lilies and arams.</p></div>
<div>
<head>ST. MARK'S CHURCH, ALEXANDRIA.</head>
<p>Large congregations attended the services yesterday, which were very bright and hearty. To the choir, who rendered so ably the Anthem, Tours’ services for matin, holy com-munion, and evensong, great credit is dee, for daring the last six weeks practises for the rendering of the “Holy City,” have required the expendition of much time and labour, in addition to what was necessary for maintaining the standard of Sunday, and Easter Day services.</p>
<p>The following sent flowers and plants:— Mines. Poster, Crafton, Picton, Rowden, Callender, Steinschneider, Dickson, Macgregor, Miss Batcheller, Mrs. Ebell, Mrs. Cornish, Non-Commissioned officers of Mounted Police, etc., etc. The following assisted in decorating the church and chapel, which presented a very pleasing and festal appearance. Mmes. Ayne, Roberts Steinschneider, Ward, Miles. Batehel-ler, Mun Gavin, Milburn Roberts, Laura Talbot.</p>
<p>April 23, was St. George’s Day, Patron Saint of England, and we noticed a fine St. George's Flag flying from a flag-staff situated at the west end of the church.</p></div>
<div>
<head>ALL SAINTS’, RAMLEH.</head>
<p>The church was very prettily decorated and the congregations at 7.30 a.m., 8.30 am., and 11 am were good. The following sent flowers,' plants, etc.: Mmes. Dotting, G. A. Williams, S H. Carver, P. W. Carver, R. J. Moss, Allen, Alderson, Briscoe, and Parkinson. The decorations were carried out by Mmes. W. R Williams, Parkinson, Ward, and Miles. Alder-son, Allen.

<head>EGYPTIAN COTTON MILLS
WINDING UP SUGGESTED.</head>
<p>The sixth annual general meeting of the
shareholders of the Egyptian Cotton Mills Ltd. was held on the 14th inst. in Wineheiter House, Old Broad-street, London, RC.</p> <p>The Secrecy (Mr. H. Spedding) read the notice convening to meeting and proceeded to say that he had-to report that the Chairman, Mr. Isidor Ellhegan was absent from the owing to illness. - The other directors were in Cairo, and nose of their were therefoe, available. It was accordingly necessary the appoint a Chairman of the meeting, and, therefore he had to move, as a shareholder, that Mr. Thomas Stoker, a former director, should take the chair.</p>
<p>Mr. T. Sheppard seconded the motion, which was agreed to.</p>    
<p>Mr. Thomas Stoker, having taken the chair, said that this was an honor which had been thrust upon him. Whan he came to the meeting that day he had no idea whatever that he should be asked to assume the pest and dignity of Chairman. As it appeased there was no other member of the company available for the post, he bad agreed to occupy the position in order to get through - the formal business of the meeting. Owing to the unfortunate illness of Mr. Ellbogen, and to the circumstances that the other directors were all resident in Cairo, the Board was entirely unexpected, and he, himself; was set in a position to other any remarks or, he feared, to answer any interrogatories. He could, therefore, only undertake to dispatch the merely routine buisness for which the meeting had been called and which they had heard read by the secretary in the notices convening the meeting. The first matter that fell upon him to do was to call upon toe secretary to read the certificate of accounts by the auditors.</p>
<p>The Secretary then read the auditors’ certificate, which was as follows: - "We report to the shareholders that we have examined the above balance-sheet, with the booked vouchers of the company in England, and with the audited balance-sheet received from Egypt, and that it is, in our opinion, properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the company’s affairs, as shown by such books and audited balance-sheet. No provision has been made for depreciation upon plant and machinery. — (Signed) Price Waterhouse and Co.”</p>
<p>The Chairman said the next buisness was to move : "That the directors’ report and balance. sheet for the year ended 30th September, l904, be adopted,” and he had pleasure in moving that resolution.</p>
<p>Mr. G. W. Dennis said he rose,  not for the purpose of seconding the resolution, but to suggest, that an expression should go forth from this meeting to the effect that this company be wound up.</p>   
<p>The Chairman said Mr. Dennis would be more in order if he permitted the resolution he had moved to be seconded, and after wards he could address the meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Spedding said he would second the motion.</p>
<p>The Chairman remarked that they were now ready to hear any remarks from shareholders.</p>

<head>SUGGESTION TO WIND UP.</head>
<p>Mr. Dennis said he had to propose, although be did not know if anyone would second it, that this meeting considered it advisable to wind up the company, seeing the disastrous state in which the company at present stood.</p>
<p>The Chairman was afraid that Mr. Dennis'. resolution, though it might be a proper matter for discussion, was out of order, in as much as he could not put it to to the meeting, no notice having been given of it This was merely an ordinary meeting, conveyed for special purposes.
Such a resolution, having for its object the winding-op of the company, would require an extraordinary meeting and a special resolution.</p>    
<p>Mr. Dennis said that what he desired was an expression of opinion on the part of the shareholders for the information of the absent directors.  </p>
<p>Mr. Sheppard said that if Mr. Dennis' motion was in order, he should, be very happy to second it.</p>
<p>The Chairman repeated that no such resolu-
tion could bo entertained, but an expression of opinion might go forth from the shareholders as suggested by Mr. Dennis. He had taken the advice of the solicitor of the company, who was present, and his views entirely concurred with those of himself—namely that they could only entertain Mr. Dennis' suggestion as an expression of opinion of the shareholders present.</p>
<p>Mr. Dennis said he would put it to the meeting as to whether it was the generalopinion that the company be wound up.</p>
<p>On a show of hands being called for, it was found that Mr. Dennis was supported Mr. Sheppard only.</p>
<p>The Chairman asked if any other share-holders desired to make any remarks, and proceeded to say that the vote which Mr. Dennis had called for committed the meeting to nothing. He would now put the resolution to the meeting.</p><p>The resolution was then put and carried.</p><p> The Chairman said the next matter before them was the election of directors, concerning which the secretary would make an announcement.</p>
<p>The Secretary then stated that the present directors, Mr. Isidor Ellborgen, Mr. S. Arbib,Mr.F.Back,Mr.S.R. Cookson and Mr. M. Roemer, all retired at this meeting in accordance with the company's articles of association, but all of them were eligible and offered themselves for re election as directors.</p>
<p>Mr. Dennis at this point asked if the Chair
man had adopted  his suggestion as to the winding-up of the company.</p>
<p>The Chairman said he had no doubt the suggestion of the two members present would be communicated to the directors as an expression of opinion. They had been informed by the secretary that the present five members of the</p></div> </div>
