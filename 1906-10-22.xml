                        <p>PAN-ISLAMISM IN NORTH AFRICA.</p>
                        <p>M. André Mévil, the well-known French
                        journalist, publishes an interesting article in
                        the "Echo de Paris" on the Pan-Islamic pro-
                        paganda and its effect upon Algeria and
                        Morocco, at the outset of which he makes a
                        pointed reference to M. Jonnart, the Gover-
                        nor-General of Algeria. Without saying that
                        his information is derived from M. Jonnart,
                        he gives it as coming from a good souce, and
                        M. Mévil is known as a serious journalist.
                        The article begins by mentioning the report
                        that M. Jonnart is to attend the next Cabinet
                        Council, which is an indication that the 
                        Fovernment desires to consult him probably 
                        on the serious question of the Moroccan
                        frontier, which is closely connected with
                        that of Morocco itself. Both, it says, react
                        directly upon Algeria, where they serve as
                        a pretext for an agitation "directed from
                        Constantinople and Cairo by way of Berlin
                        It will be understood that this is a matter
                        calculated to inspire the Government with a 
                        certain amount of anxiety." The following
                        is the result of M. Mévil's inquiry into a</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>state of affairs which he says might one day become a serious menace for
                            French domination in North Aftica. Notwithstanding the satisfactory
                            economic condition of Algeria and the comparativ prosperity of the
                            natives in consequence of a good harvest, the Arab population mani fests
                            the greates hostility towards the French. There have been numerous
                            robberies in many places, particularly of cattle, as well as the murder
                            of several Europeans--a state of affairs which has naturally excited
                            much feeling among the French settlers in the interior, where they live
                            in the midst of a population 20 times as numerous as themselves. The
                            tele- graph brings daily accounts of fresh attacks, and two days ago the
                            gendarmes were mal- treated by a furious crowd of Arabs at Ain Bessam.
                            These incidents are in no way due to any relaxation of administrative
                            surveil lance. It is not impossible that the crimes which are taking
                            place in Algeria have some connection with the revival of fanaticism now
                            manifest throughout all North Africa, "which Germany regards with less
                            apprehension than we do, and which she seems even to encour- age by her
                            attitude towards the Moroccan Government. We have reason to be on our
                            guard in that direction also. The Maghzen has assumed airs towards us
                            and taken pro- ceedings such as it had never taken before, even last
                            year at the most critical stage of the Moroccan crisis. </p>
                        <p>“The inhabitants of Tafilet, supported is their hostility towards our
                            commercial penetration, resort to all sorts of threats and intrigues to
                            boycott the products transported by oar railway. . . . The tranquility
                            of the economic life of a part of Algeria is thus daily threatened.
                            Besides, the Berates of Tafilet spare no pains to induce the tribes
                            subject to us on the frontier to leave our territory and even to join in
                            the attack upon us. This is a thoroughly intolerable state of affairs.
                            It is known that in the north the disposition. of the Moroccan
                            authorities towards us is scarcely better. We can hardly count upon
                            anything more than their inaction. ... ‘I am told that in the settlement
                            of these questions, both in the north and south of our frontier region,
                            the Governor is determined to maintain his composure. At, the same time
                            the Charbonnier affair has shown us what can be secured from the Maghzcn
                            by an energetic demonstration. If the Moroccan Government does not
                            accede to our very moderate demands, which are but too well justified,
                            we shall remember that a strong policy is often necessary at Fez. As
                            will be seen, the Moroccan question still reserves for us more than one
                            surprise and difficulty, as we still have adversaries who know well how
                            to embroil it. Let us be on our guard, since our security in North
                            Africa depends exclusively upon our own vigilance."</p>
                        <p>The same journal publishes telegrams from Algiers and Constantinople
                            dealing with the effervescence among the Arab population. According to
                            the statement made by the lieutenant in command of the gendarmerie at
                            Ain Beasam, the attack made upon them by the Arabs was unprovoked and
                            took place with, a suddennnes that betrayed premeditation and concert.
                            During the mélée that followed one of the sheikhs was particularly
                            prominent in inciting the crowd. According to the despatch from
                            Constantine, the audacity of the native bandits is increasing daily.
                            Indeed' they now extend their operations almost to the gates of that
                            town. Quite recently several travelled were stoned by natives, and Borne
                            of them were fired upon just outside the town.</p>

                        Church yesterday, when, during the singing of that beautiful hymn of
                        Cardinal Newman, “Lead Kindly Light,” the electric light went out. The
                        choir, however, showed great presence of mind, and sang through the hymn
                        without a break, and after a few prayers an exit was made from the darkness,
                        illuminated by the faint gleams of two oil-lamps.</p>
                    <p>Fallen Heroes.</p>
                    <p>A dramatic scene was witnessed at Aldershot this day week, when, consequent
                        on the War Stores Commission revelations, First-class Staff- Sergeant Major
                        Beavan and Staff Sergeant Mills, A.S.C., were discharged from the Army for
                        misconduct under paragraph 1805, XI, King’s Regulations, and ordered to
                        leave the barracks at once. The blow fell very hard on the Sergeant-Major.
                        On the breast of his tunic he could display six medals and eight clasps
                        including the distinguished conduct medal, the Queen and King’s medals, the
                        Sudan medal, the Khedive’s Star, and the good conduct medal. All these he
                        had to hand over to his guard. He has had twenty-two years’ service, and
                        because of his excellent career in South Africa he had been recommended for
                        a commission, and the recommendation had been approved. He was on the point
                        of being promoted when the War Stores inquiry shattered his hopes.</p>
                    <p>NEW EGYPTOLOGICAL BOOK.</p>
                    <p>Ancient Records of Egypt. By James Henry Breasted, Ph.D. Vol. IV. (University
                        of Chicago Press. 13s. 6d.)—Professor Breasted completes his Egyptian work
                        with this volume He has now given us a history, and four volumes of the
                        documents, from inscriptions and papyri, on which the history is founded.
                        All that remains to make these labours generally available is the complete
                        index which is announced to be about to follow. Vol. IV. contains the
                        records of seven dynasties (XX.-XXVI.), a period of something more than six
                        hundred years. The Twentieth Dynasty may be fixed, with approximate
                        accuracy, as beginning about 1200 B.C. It is the Rameside dynasty, and
                        though it covers not much more than a century, its records occupy
                        considerably more than half of this volume. It is to this period that the
                        famous "Papyrus Harris” belongs. This papyrus is the largest (133 ft. long)
                        and the most sumptuous of all that have come down to ns. It gives an
                        elaborate account of the property and income of the gods as these were on
                        the death of Rameses III. (1198 1167). It is almost needless to say that
                        this ^record, which Professor Breasted has carefully translated, is of the
                        greatest value; the average reader, however, will find the concluding
                        sections in which the King recounts the circumstances in which the dynasty
                        rose into power most interesting. Another noteworthy document is the “Harem
                        Conspiracy.” This refers to the same reign. One of the Queens of Rameses
                        III. sought to obtain the succession for her son. The story is one that
                        occurs over and over again in Oriental records, and we are at once reminded
                        of the intrigues which troubled the last day8of David. That, too, is not a
                        pleasing story; but the “Harem Conspiracy,” so far as we are able to discern
                        it3 outlines, has a far worse appearance. In $499 556 we have legal
                        documents relating to the tomb robberies. A list of the tombs, etc.,
                        inspected is given, beginning with that of Amenhotep I. This was found
                        uninjured, and so were molt of the others. The pyramid of King Sebekemsaf, a
                        petty Sovereign of the sixteenth century, was found to have suffered most.
                        The later Kings left few records behind them. For the Twenty sixth Dynasty,
                        the latest of the native Kings, though it lasted for nearly a century and a
                        half, about forty pages suffice.</p>

                    <p>the international problem.</p>
                    <p>Cologne, October 21. The "Cologne Gazette” refutes the assertion that before
                        the commencement of the Wireless Telegraphy Conference the German Government
                        had asked the French Government to insist on stations employing the Marconi
                        systems on board French ships accepting wireless messages of other systems.
                        This information is baseless, as well as the assertions concerning the
                        pretended anti-British controversies. The German delegates are endeavouring,
                        as well as the rest, to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion in this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>This international problem is one of the most difficult. No negotiations have
                        been carried on with any Power which have not been entered into with the
                        others at the same time. It is a great error to pretend that a German
                        victory at the Conference would mean a British defeat. It is hard to see in
                        what sense this could be. (Reuter•)</p>

                    <p>Selby Abbey has been completely destroyed by fire. The flames spread from the
                        gas engine working the organ. An explosion occurred which blew out the north

                    <p>Selby Abbey is part of an abbey built by the Benedictine monks in the 10th

                        except St. Mary’s Abbey, whose ruins are one of the sights of York, north of
                        the Trent. It is a magnificent cruciform structure 300 feet long and 60 feet
                        wide. The nave is one of the finest 8p6oimens of Norman architecture, the
                        choir is noted for its handsome decorations, and beyond it is a very
                        beautiful lady chapel. Near the close of the 17th century the south transept
                        was destroyed by the fall of the upper part of the central ower.</p>

                    <p>Keneh, Monday.</p>
                    <p>A frst-class carriage of the express train which left Luxor for Cairo at
                        half-past five yesterday caught fire by the explosion of a lamp in one of
                        the compartments. The train was immediately brought to a standstill and the
                        burning carriage detached about three kilometres south of Kift.</p>
                    <p>The villagers were called out to assist in getting the flames under, and the
                        inspector in charge of the Assouan district appeared on the scene very
                        promptly. Energetic measures were taken and after hard work met with
                        success. Three Italians distinguished themselves by the coolness and the

                        Constitution in accordance with the principles of Western civilisation. This
                        step is strongly criticised by Farid Bey in "A1 Lewa” on the ground that,
                        inasmach as Great Britain’s position in Egypt is illegal, the presentation
                        oi the petition to Lord Cromer was tantamount to a recognition of the

                    <p> PRINCE.</p>
                    <p>News has just come to hand of the safe arrival at Malta of the S.S. Scottish
                        Prince, which left this port on the 9th inst. bound for Manchester with a
                        cargo of cotton.</p>
                    <p>It appears that on Saturday week, at 4 a m., when about 120 miles off Malta,
                        the web of the lower pressure crank shaft broke, leaving the ship
                        practically helpless. An attempt was made to work her slowly into port, hot
                        at noon it had to be abandoned, and it was decided to make an effort to
                        repair the damage done, by putting a strap around the shaft. This was
                        successfully done with a band off a mast and steel rod, and by $.30 that
                        evening everything was ready and a start again made. The weather being fine
                        at the time, no difficulty was experienced, and the engines were worked
                        slowly with frequent stops, until within 9 miles of Malts, when a fresh
                        strap had to be put on, hut as this had been made ready in case of emergency
                        it did not take long to place, and by midnight on Sunday the vessel was
                        safely moored.</p>
                    <p>The place where the accident occurred is in the track of steamers from Malta
                        to Alexandria and where there is very little traffic, and had the weather
                        not been fine at the time, or had the ship drifted to the southward, she
                        would have stood a very poor chance of obtaining any assistance, in the

                    </p>
                    <p>A few days ago we drew attention to the questions that hid recently been
                        asked in the House of Commons on the extraordinary growth of drink imports
                        into the Sudan. That the question fully deserves the attention of the House
                        of Commons nobody will deny, and its serious aspect becomes more apparent
                        when the figures are contrasted with the extent of the population of the
                        Sudan. Spirits to the amount of 561 tons, valued at L.E. 119,738, came into
                        the Sudan in 1904, while the value of the liquor imports last year was L.E.
                        84,000.</p>
                    <p>According to Lord Cromer’s latest report the population of the country is
                        estimated at a total of 1,853,000 persons, of whom 10,396 are foreigners,
                        viz, 2,787 Europeans, 8,209 Abys- sinians, Egyptians, Indians, etc. His
                        Lordship remarks: “The point moat to be noted in the calculations submitted
                        by the local authorities is the very large proportion of children. Thu3, of
                        90,000 persons in the province of Dongola it is estimated that over 43.000,
                        or thirty-two per cent, of the total, are children under nine years of
                        age.”</p>
                    <p>The adult male population of the Sudan bears, therefore, a very small
                        proportion to the estimated total of 1,853,000 given by Lord Cromer, and yet
                        in 1904 spirits to the value of L.E. 119,738 were imported. It need scarcely
                        be pointed out that this immoderate use of spirits by savage or
                        semi-civilised people in a tropical climate is a far deadlier and more
                        insiduous foe than plague, pestilence, or famine. Savage races are not
                        decimated but exterminated by strong drink, and the enormous increase in
                        this class of imports is-a terrible reflection on the evils attendant on
                        what is called civilisation. Lord Cromer recognised the significance of
                        these figures, and in a penultimate report he remarked: “The valuation of
                        L.E. 119,738 would appear to be unusually high. I am, however, informed that
                        the balk of spirituous liquors, which come into the Sudan, is of good
                        quality.”</p>
                    <p>But surely this is only the palliation of an evil which ought to have been
                        checked long before it assumed its present gigantic proportions. If it is
                        possible for the authorities to 8top a newspaper like “Al Minbar” from
                        entering the Sudan on the ground of the dangerous character of its political
                        opinions, surely it is far more incumbent on them to prevent the huge growth
                        in the imports of spirits! But the official standpoint probably is that the
                        criticism of "Al Minbar” is far more deleterious to the mind of the Sudanese
                        than £119,738 worth of spirits can be to their bodies, which is an indirect
                        compliment to "Al Minbar.” ,</p>

                            <p>(From a Correspondent.)</p>
                            <p>The circular of. the committee formed for the establishment of a
                                national university, a translation of which was recently printed in
                                the "Egyptian Gazette,” is remarkable for its restraint and for its
                                common sense. When the proposal was first mooted there were not
                                looking those among us who spoke of Pan- Islam; and it is probable
                                that there were some who may have thought that the movement offered
                                further scope for political intrigue. The committee, "however, have
                                proved themselves to be influenced by a higher patriotism, and to
                                have the true interests of their country at heart. "The university
                                that we desire to create is to be absolutely scientific and
                                literary. Its doors will be wide open for all desirous of learning,
                                irrespective of origin and religion. It will have no connection at
                                all with politics, or even with men who occupy themselves with
                                politics. “Here indeed is true patriotism: a patriotism which
                                considers the welfare of “Egyptians,” and not of any particular sect
                                or section of the very composite Egyptian nation. A patriotism which
                                is above party.</p>
                            <p>The national university movement is not another proof of "unrest.”
                                Those who are. most closely connected with the present educational
                                system of Egypt are most aware of its defects; and among the first
                                to admit the inadequacy of the present system are those most largely
                                responsible for it. The Adviser to the Ministry of Education and
                                Lord Cromer both admit that the Government system does not meet all
                                the requirements of the country. The Government primary, secondary,
                                and higher schools are maintained for a special purpose- the
                                education of a class of men who will be able to fill posts in the
                                different Government departments. The education policy of the
                                Egyptian Government is to provide for itself a class of young
                                Egyptians who will be able to assist in the administration of the
                                State. These men are theoretically dedicated to the service of the
                                State, and the cost of their education is, for the most part, borne
                                by the State, the student only paying L.E. 15 oat of L.E. 78. This
                                being the Government policy, the education provided is directed
                                almost entirely towards the special end in view, and is, therefore,
                                not entirely suited to the student who does not intend to enter
                                Government service. In Lord Cromer’s words: "The</p>
                            <p>Government system of schools, which dates back to a period long
                                before the British occupation, is designed to provide in the main a
                                European education. The system was not conceived, and cannot be
                                regarded, as a complete expression of the national needs in the
                                matter of education, nor can it be taken as representing the lines
                                along which educational development should advance
                                indefinitely.”</p>
                            <p>Present System of Education.</p>
                            <p>Lord Cromer has repeatedly said that the system of education, at
                                present provided by the Government, is of a special character and
                                intended for a special purpose: that it is not a system which is
                                suited to all; that a more "national” system is necessary, but the
                                finances of the State do not admit of this more popular education
                                being provided by the Government, that it must be provided by
                                private effort.</p>
                            <p>“Today,” we read in the circular before us, “Egyptians are beginning
                                to feel that there is in their education a very large gap which must
                                be filled.” Egyptians realise that there is something wanting,
                                something that is not given by the Government; but until something
                                better is provided Egyptians mast be content with what they can get
                                in the Government schools. Not is the position of the Egyptian
                                reformer an easy one. The Government provide education at a fifth of
                                its cost; is it surprising that private enterprise finds it
                                difficult to compete with the State 1 Is it, under these
                                circumstances, surprising that the committee for the establishment
                                of the national university are doubtful of the success of their
                                movement 1</p>
                            <p>What is it that our education reformers desire 1 And could not the
                                Government itself do something to "fill the gap?” “In order that
                                Egypt may be admitted to the ranks of civilised countries, it Joes
                                not suffice that the majority of its population know I19W to read
                                and write, nor, farther, that a class be found for professional
                                knowledge, such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc.” There must be
                                encouragement given to those who desire to study for the sake of
                                “Knowledge” alone, who desire that Egypt should take a place in the
                                world among those states which produce the great writers, the great
                                scientists, the great historians, the great discoverers of this age.
                                "Bat what is truly astonishing is this: There is' not in the whole
                                of Egypt a class where are taught the literary, scientific, and
                                philosophical works of the best known and most appreciated in Europe
                                of the ancient Arab authors 1” Is a great historic language to be

                            <p>An important reform has recently been made in the Government
                                education system. The Primary certificate has ceased to have its
                                ancient value, and the Secondary schools have undergone an important
                                modification. A student who has obtained the Primary certificate now
                                finds that the Government offices are not yet open to him, that he
                                must prolong his studies yet a little longer; he must enter the
                                Secondary schools.</p>

                            <p>The work in the Secondary schools is now divided into two parts. A
                                student on entering first follows what is practically the old
                                syllabus for two years, when he finds that be must take an
                                examination. If he is successful in this he finds himself at the
                                parting of three ways: he may apply for a government post of minor
                                importance, or h) may elect to remain at the Secondary school either
                                on the literary or scientific side. The first leads to the School of
                                Law and thence either to a professional life, or to a post of some
                                importance in one or other of the Ministries of Law, Interior, or
                                Finance; if, however, he elects to follow a more scientific form of
                                study, he chooses the second, and ultimately finds himself qualified
                                to enter the School of Medicine or the School of Engineering, with
                                ultimately a career before him either in government service or as a
                                professional man. To pat it shortly, the three years’ study of the
                                Secondary schools has been reduced to two years, and an intermediate
                                school has been added between the Secondary and Higher schools with
                                a two years’ course of study.</p>
