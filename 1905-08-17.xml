                    <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                    <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <head>Mr. Machell's Campaign</head>
                    <p>Every cultivator of cotton mUst be gratified to note the considerable
                        decrease in the number of feddans of cotton-land attacked by the
                        cotton-worm, which has been evident for the past few weeks, as shown by the
                        weekly reports issued by the Ministry of the Interior. Egypt is above all a
                        cotton-growing country and it is essential,for the welfare of the country at
                        large, and of the fellah who looks to the yield of cotton from his small
                        plot of land for his daily bread, that every effort should be made to cope
                        with any insect pest, such as the cotton-worm, which may threaten to damage
                        the staple. The cotton-worms this year have appeared in enormous numbers,
                        and there was every indication that the crops would suffer materially from
                        their ravages. The Ministry of the Interior, however, realising the gravity
                        of the situation, took the matter in hand, and under the direction of Mr.
                        Machell organised a warfare against this pest which has met with a greater
                        success than was anticipated by the most sanguine. The method, which has
                        proved so successful, is the picking by hand of those leaves upon which the
                        ootton-worm has laid its eggs, and burning them. No doubt hand-picking is
                        laborious, and has also necessitated the temporary re-introduction of the
                        corvee, but its efficacy is an ample justification of its adoption,and,
                        since no other means with whioh the pest can be successfully combatted has
                        been found, the fact that the corvee has been put into force can meet with
                        no objection on the part of any person capable of forming a sound judgment.
                        The damage to the crops this year, thanks to the energy with which the
                        inspectors of the Ministry of the Interior have performed their part of the
                        task, promises to be very slight. The destruction whioh the worm caused last
                        year was very considerable, no less than half of the crop being ruined in
                        some districts.</p>
                    <p>Another and much simpler method has been suggested by Mr. Richmond of the
                        Aboukir Land Company, which consists in the applica-tion of two or three
                        gallons of petroleum per feddan with the first watering which is given to
                        the land after the sowing of the seeds—a method, by the way, which has been
                        folly described in our columns, —and experiments are being carried out in
                        this direction at the suggestion of the Ministry of the Interior, If this
                        plan proves successful,</p>
                    <p>it will be adopted next year, bnt it has not been fully demonstrated, as yet,
                        that it is certain to prove effective. A proof of the efficacy of the method
                        at present in use, and of the assiduity with which it is carried out is
                        found iu the fact that the Augiut, or third brood has up to the present been
                        very scarce.</p>
                    <p>In former years this brood bis always proved the most numerous, probably iu
                        consequence of the neglect of the two earlier broods of June and July, and
                        has therefore done the most damage, bnt in many places where the worms have
                        appeared in abundance early in the present year, all trace of them has
                        disappeared, and no eggs are to be found. August, too, is the season when
                        the Nedwet el Assal appears, and the Ministry of the Interior have turned
                        their attention to its destruction, and are urging upon cultivators the
                        necessity of spraying the leaves of all cotton-plants, in the vicinity of
                        any plant which has been attacked by the nedwet, with a mixture of soap,
                        kerosene or paraffin oil, and water. This prescription has met with perfect
                        success wherever it has been applied, but unfortunately a number of
                        cultivators fail to realise the necesity of taking these precautionary
                        measures, and have in consequence suffered from the visit of the fungus
                        which follows on the nedwet, and which is the real destructive agent. It is
                        asserted by some that the danger of the cotton-worm and its prevalence have
                        been exaggerated; bnt these critics forget that had no attention, or
                        insufficient attention, been paid to it, their oomplaints would have been
                        loud and bitter,and they would have heaped ’ recriminations upon the heads
                        of the unfortunate authorities whom they now accuse of making "much ado
                        about nothing.” Such reasoning is like that of the child who frets because
                        it is taken too much care of in an illness, the negligence of which might
                        prove disastrous, but is incapable of looking farther forward than the next
                        five minutes,</p>
                    <p>We are very glad to observe that our local contemporaries of every
                        nationality recognise the excellence of the work which has been done, and
                        the indefatigable energy with which Mr. Machell and his subordinates have
                        performed their task. Mr. Machell has indeed shown that he has the true
                        interests of the country at heart, that he is an able administrator, and
                        that no private interests will stand in the way of his public duties. He has
                        remained out here during the wont months of an exceptionally hot and trying
                        summer, he has himself directed and superintended the work, and has paid
                        innumerable visits of inspection to the clearing operations in the
                        widely-separated districts in which they have proved necessary. His efforts
                        have been most laudable, and have been crowned with the thorough success
                        which they deserved, and he has now been able to retire for a short space of
                        time to a cooler climate, where he can recuperate himself for the arduous
                        tasks of the coming year, assured that he has done his best, and has been of
                        great service to the country in which he takes such a deep interest Among
                        other papers which have spoken of Mr. Machell’s devotion is the "Bulletin de
                        l'Union Syndicale” which gives the following appreciation of his work: "The
                        work of stripping off the (affected) leaves has been continued with success.
                        It is fitting to congratulate the Government upon the measures taken, but
                        the gratitude of the cultivators is chiefly due to Mr. Machell, who has
                        directed the execution of the work with skill, and with an energy to which
                        all must render due homage. The decree concerning the leaf-stripping was
                        wise, but the application of it was difficult. In order that it should have
                        full effect, it was necessary to find a man of initiative, knowing the
                        country, knowing how to carry out his wishes, a man who had already given
                        proof of his ability, a man inspiring such confidence in the Government that
                        he might count upon organising an effective and thorough cooperation in the
                        campaign, and who might be granted full powers over the civil and military
                        staff of the mudiriehs, with the certainty that the measures of repression,
                        which he would eventually have to take, would be ratified. The man was found
                        in Mr. Machell. All those who have seen him at work, all those who are
                        witnesses of the result obtained, will agree in declaring that he has been,
                        as far as any one could wish, equal to his task.” Such praise is, in our
                        opinion, right well deserved. Let us add that those who have worked in the
                        provinces as inspectors, and in other capacities, have ably seconded Mr.
                        Machell's efforts, and are also well worthy of the thanks of the country for
                        having assisted in saving it from what would undoubtedly have been a serious
                        disaster, had not the measures prescribed been faithfully and energetically
                        carried out</p>
