                    <p>*</p>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes : — Cannot something be said or done to abate
                        the great­est nuisance and offence of Cairo, the donkey- boys to wit 1 The
                        shoeblacks, match-sellers, and others are improving daily ; we are no louger
                        pestered except by isolated specimens; and those have the excuse of extreme
                        youth and its consequent impishness. But your donkey boy‘is a real plague.
                        He is usually an "adult," of a very low class, and up Jo the eyes steeped in
                        vice ; that we all know, we need not enlarge thereon. Happily one does not
                        need to pause and hear what “induce­ments” he has to offer for one’s
                        patronage : but he should surely be absolutely forbidden (as is now largely
                        the case at Meoa House) to accost or speak to people l for in this he is our
                        "béte noire." It is impossible to walk quietly past a group of donkey-boys
                        without “Coming, sarr, nioe donkey, sarr,” and much more howled at one, or
                        to stop a moment without excitibga general charge. No reproof has any effebt
                        un­less it be to bring a flow of filthy language. I speak for the residents
                        more than tor visitors. We may not hit.them (they knowthatl) and we most of
                        us cannot waste our time by calling the attention of the nearest policeman.
                        They (the boys) know perfectly well who is resident and who is not, aud I am
                        certain they take a pleasure iu annoying us. Besides, the tone of voice—as
                        if they had been our trusted guides since infancy in every kind of vioe—is
                        an insult How often has it not infariated me when walking peacefully along
                        the streets 1 As if I wanted to ride a donkey, or as if I hadn’t a tongue in
                        my head, or a pair of eyes, to speak and choose for myself as I would a cab.
                        I appeal to the authorities : it would be so easy to give a general order
                        that none ol these people are to acoost passers ; they are all numbered, all
                        have their regular stands aud ranks. Almost always a "shawish” is somewhere
                        within reach ; and if one or two examples were made, we should soon find the
                        Cairo streets peaceful.</p>
