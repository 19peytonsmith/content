But with the Kaiser it is otherwise. This
dreamy man of action, this virile mystic, grasps
the ee-jret of Japanese power. The magnificent
discipline of this Navy and Army, he told his
recruits, "springs from patriotism and filial
love.” It is the outcome of all that we have
oome to recognise in the word “Bashido."
"Honorable brothers, let us throw ourselves on
the bayonets. Our comrades will take the posi-
tion over our bodies.” Whst man with the soul
of a Paladin, as has tha Kaiser, ooald toil to
have his blood set a-tingle by the heroism of
the Japanese major of whom that speech is
reported, or to recognise that here is a force
before which “mightiest tieeta of iron framed"
and “all-shattering guns” are powerless, unless
the men whose will they obey are instinct with
a like spirit</p>
<p>It is not, however, as brothers-in-arms that
William Il.greetsthe Japanese with the salute
due to virtue and oonrage. Ra’.har they are
the "scourge of God,” as was Attila, and—by
a juxtaposition which reveals in a flash his
mentality—Napoleon. “Buddha is not superior
to our Lord Christ," cries this Crusader of to-
day. If the Russians have toiled, it must be
that Russian Christianity is in a very bad way;
German Christianity is in a bad way also, and
the German sovereign doubts whether, "in the
event of a war, the Germans would be justified
in praying to God for victory.” There is an
old-world splendour about this utterance,
surprising as it is from the proud ruler of the
German peoples, which a materialistic age
should not miss. The sovereign who stood on
Olivet, clad, so nearly as might be, in the
Crusaders’ panoply, and there dreamed his
dreams, calls on his soldiers to be even as the
knights of old : to watch and prey by their
armour, keeping their hearts pure that their
strength may be as the strength of ten. The
sword of the German Michael must be tem-
pered in the armoury of God.</p>
<p>We want to bring home to oar readers the
significance of this ntterenoe, so greatly at
variance with the tendenoy of modern thought.
The grandiose conception of the famous alle-
gorieal picture still teems in the Emperor’s
brain. The Teuton still stands, in the mujesty
of a pare and simple toith, as the protector of
he apostate white races against the enemy
which cometh in like a flood, as Attila oame
before him, from the East. Attila the trembling
priests of his time named "the Sconrge of
Godbut, later there arose another whom
Chriitendom hailed as the "Hammer of God"
—Charles Martel, who tamed back the
Saraoens from Europe at Tonre. William II.,
German Emperor, would be the "Hammer of
God."</p></div>

GERMANY IN THE FAR EAST.
The very sensational news telegraphed from
Tokio last evening by Reuter, to the effeot that
a German force had occupied Hai-chu, situated
on an extensive bay to the northward of the
old channel of the Hong-Ho, is, we are glad to
see, officially denied from Berlin to-day. Had
the very improbable occurrence actually taken
place, it would have been difficult to foresee
the results to which it would have led. Where
there is smoke, however, there is fire, and
in the immediate future we can foresee, not
only that German policy will be directed might
and main to placing obstacles in the way of
Japanese success, but alas that when the
settlement oomea, it will strive at all hazard to
prevent what the Emperor considers dangerous
aggrandisement of the destined foe of Christ-
endom. That William II. recognises so warmly
tho admirable qualities of those whom he
regards as a “soourge of God” adds to the
perils of the international situation. The
revival of the spirit in whioh the Crusaders
faced the Paynims will be a new and troubling
element in the comfortable world of to-day.
The remarkable speech delivered by the
Bmperor William to the reornits sworn in at
Wilhelmshaven on March 9th, and only now
reported, however, gives some food for reflec
tion on the under currents which really direct
i he situation. The treatment received by the
Japaneee at the hands of the neutral Powers
of the Continent has been so exceptional that
it has always appeared as though the military
freemasonry which controls the oonnoils of those
Powers was unable to oonceive that a branch
of the Yellow Raoe could be inoluded within
the pale of civilisation; that,despite the perfec-
tion of their naval and military organisation,
the Japanese were, after all, only regarded as
Dervishes with a scientific education.</p></div>
<div type="item"><p>THE NEED OF A BRITISH
HOSPITAL.
A correspondent writes to us suggesting
that we should invite expressions of opinion as
o the great need which many think exists for
the establishment of either a British Cottage
Hospital or Naming Home in Alexandria, and
the possibility and advisability of taking steps
in order to supply the want It will be within
the recollection of our readers that this ques-
tion was mooted in our columns a few months
ago, at the time that attention was direoted to
it by the lamented death ot a promising young
Englishman from small-pox, contracted while
convalescent from fever at one of onr hospitals,
Nothing, however, has resalted from the
oorrespondenoe that took place, and no steps
have, as far as we are aware, been taken,
even in the direction of the establishment
of an international isolation hospital for the
treatment of contagions diseases, a matter which
seemed to be at the time, and impresses ns
still, as being one of urgenoy. It stands, how-
ever, quite apart from the question of tho
establishment of a purely British hospital, and
that is the subject upon which we should be
glad to have the views of our readers. Every-
body knows how condnoive it is to recovery for
a patient to be surrounded with favorable
conditions, and the feelings of contentment
induced even in the ooume of a painful
illness by the knowledge that dootora,
names, and attendants are of one’s own
nationality, are not considerations to be
dismissed as of trifling aooonnt We all like
our suffering ones to have every possible
amelioration of their condition, and where such
a question as that of the establishment of a
Cottage Hospital is concerned perhaps funds
would more readily flow for its erection, than
for many other purely national objects,—a club
or library for instanoe. We leave the matter
for our readers’ consideration, and will will-
ingly publish any communications on the
subject with which we may be favored.</p></div>
