                    <p>TRAFTIC IN HONOURS</p>
                    <p>It is worth noting at a moment when there is some talk about the necessity of
                        only granting decorations and grades in Egypt for merit, that King Edward is
                        starting a similar movement in England. "The information which we have had
                        placed at our disposal,” says ‘The Throne” of the24thalto.,"enables us to
                        state with authority that His Majesty views with extreme disfavour the
                        flagrant manner in which titles have been exploited for party purposes in
                        recent years, and will discountenance most strongly any promotions in the
                        future which are based upon mere liberal contributions to the party funds
                        Titles which ought to be conferred only upon men of high distinction in the
                        realm of intellectual activity have been knocked down to the highest bidder,
                        and these facts have not been disclosed when the name of the prospective
                        peer has been placed before His Majesty for approval. Sir William Jones, in
                        his famous ode in imitation of Alcseus, has given us a magnificent ideal of
                        the State. He reminded us, in words of singular force and beauty, that it
                        does not consist of 'starr'd and spangled courts, where low-bred baseness
                        wafts perfume to pride,’ but of high-minded men, 'men who their duties know,
                        but know their rights, snd, knowing, dare maintain.’ If England as a nation
                        is to realise that ideal, the honours which she has to confer upon her
                        distinguished sons must not be bought and sold in the political
                        market-place, but should be preserved as a priceless reward for those whose
                        lofty character and intellectual equipment fit them to become the
                        forerunners of a race of statesmen.”</p>

                    <p>P. AND O. REPORT</p>
                    <p>This great company manages to pay 13 per cent. on its Deferred stock with
                        wonderful regularity, and it is fortunate not only in having different
                        sources of revenue, to that where one may fail another makes good the
                        deficiency, but also in having a thoroughly business-like board of
                        directors. It will come as no surprise to stockholders that the freight
                        returns for the year ended September 30 do not compare favourably with those
                        of the previous year, though the apparent deficiency is only £67,475 on a
                        total receipt of £1,521,309, and of this £31,600 is set down to less
                        Government work and lower rates, but the deficiency would have been greater
                        had it not been for the earnings of certain extra voyages. Outward Indian
                        trade was demoralised by a conflict between the English and German lines
                        engaged in the Antwerp branch of this trade, while homeward freights from
                        Indian ports were considerably below the normal point, and cargo was often
                        exceptionally scarce. In Australia freights also suffered in consequence of
                        a fall of nearly 50 per cent in the carrying rates for refrigerated produce,
                        and the cargo fleet engaged in the local trade between India, China, and
                        Japan was not so fully employed as in the previous year. The passenger
                        season, however, was a good one, the total traffic of £1,087,407 being an
                        improvement of £102,719 on last year, but the expense of working the new
                        vessels engaged in this service, which are much larger than the ships
                        replaced, and the further disbursements arising from the extra voyages,
                        materially swelled the expenditure, which, apart from the sinking fund,
                        shows an excess in the cost of navigating the fleet of upwards of £100,000,
                        a considerable proportion of which is attributable to the acceleration of
                        the mail service. The net result of the year's operations is really, very
                        satisfactory, for after setting aside for depreciation £461,097 to sinking
                        fund,the board is enabled to recommend une dividend and bonus as last
                        year.</p>

                        <p>"The Sphinx."</p>
                        <p>Our bright little winter contemporary, the "Sphinx," has made its debut
                            for the season, while entering on its fourteenth year. Last week’s issue
                            (the second this season) is if anything an improvement on the first, and
                            both are full of interest to the resident and tourist alike. The journal
                            has the same features as last year—society gossip in Cairo and London,
                            chit-chat interesting personalis, visitors’ lists, "Fashions of the
                            Moment,’’ "Finance and Matters Financial,” a short story by a well-known
                            author, humorous tit-bits, and well-selected articles, besides a number
                            of illustrations, etc. The addition of a new printing department
                            equipped with the most modern machinery and the latest type has enabled
                            the publishers to bring out a handsome publication, which does credit to
                            all concerned.</p>

                        <p>British Club.</p>
                        <p>The smoking concert given at the British Club on Saturday was a great
                            success in every way, and it is to be hoped will prove to be only the
                            first of a series of similar entertainments. Mr. Heaton opened with a
                            pianoforte solo, and ably served as so accompanist throughout. Mr.
                            Parvis was in good form in the two solos he gave, especially in the
                            favorite "Veteran’s Song.” He also joined Mr. Sarjeant in a fine
                            rendering of a very telling duet, "Watchman, what of the Night!"
                            composed by Mr. Sarjeant's brother. Mr. De Rougemont delighted every one
                            with his whistling, which beautifully true, and also sang a couple of
                            songs. Mr. Pearce Hill, always a favourite, brought his dolls and
                            managed to check their hilarity though not that of the audience. Mr.
                            Dodwell is a master hand at entertaining, and kept all in roars of
                            laughter throughout his sketches and songs. M.D'Ambra gave four
                            selections on the violin with charming effect and exquisite touch. The
                            chair was taken at first by Sir Massie Blomfield, but owing to the
                            serious illness of Lady Blomfield he had to leave at the interval, and
                            Mr. Gould presided for the rest of the evening. Votes of thanks were
                            pasted to the chairman, and to Mr. Sarjeant for arranging the concert.
                            At the close the prizes won in the billiard handicap were presented by
                            Mr. Gould to the winners, Messrs. Legge, Wood and Sampson.</p>

                                occurred at Mit Assas this morning and in which one Syrian gentleman

                                continue their journeys. The collision occurred during a thick fog.
                                An official erquiry is being made as to the exact cause. Traffic was
                                entirely blocked for some hours, but by this afternoon normal

                                Director General of the Public Health Department, at Ghezireh, was
                                broken into by burglars and a considerable amount of old silver
                                plate removed. The police have the affair in hand and are making

                            <p>The Hamburg and Anglo-American Nile Company gave a very pleasant "At
                                Home” on board their dahabeah Nubia yesterday afternoon. This fine
                                boat was moored to the land-ing-stage close to Kaar-el-Nil, and was
                                in gala attire, palms and flowers being in profusion and every
                                comfort provided for the guests. Asump-tuous tea was provided in the
                                dainty saloon, which was set out with little tables, while less
                                innocent drinks were served from the smoking-room on the upper desk.
                                The Nubia is one of the finest of this company’s steamers, and her
                                accommodation offers every comfort. The roomy cabins have large and
                                airy windows ; and every window is fitted with mosquito blinds, and
                                the cabins all contain ample shelves and chests of drawers and Other
                                conveniences not often met with on board any boat. The upper deck is
                                glazed in at the bows so that no untoward breeze may interfere with
                                the comfort of the passengers ; and everything has been done to
                                ensure the arrangements being as perfect as possible. A continuous
                                stream of people took advantage of the company’s invitation to
                                inspect the vessel; and though some of the guests came expecting an
                                afternoon cruise on the river there were few who were not satisfied
                                with the entertainment offered them.</p>

                            <p>A Cairo correspondent writer Five months ago La Societe d’Entreprises
                                Immobilieres et de Travanx,. Cairo, made arrangements to take over
                                10% (80,000 pips) of the land owned by La Societe Civile des
                                Terrains Cleopatre of Alexandria. This land has a superficial area
                                of about .300.000 pies, and is situated at Ibrahimieh (Alexandria)
                                on the sea front. They bought the land in Jane last from Messrs.
                                Stagni and Zervudachi for P.T. 101 per pic. The Municipality has now
                                decided to extend the Alexandria promenade quay as far as Sidi
                                Gaber, which work will necessitate catting through the whole length
                                of the Cleopatre possessions. The necessary funds for carrying out
                                this work have already been voted by the Municipality. One can see
                                at a glance that the value of this property has already been
                                considerably enhanced, and it is estimated that there will be no
                                difficulty in obtaining P.T. 200 to P.T. 230 per pic for this land.
                                At the present moment there are firm offers on hand lor certain
                                parcels at P.T. l60 per pic. which represents a net profit of P.T.
                                69 per pic on purchase price. If tbe Societe d'Entreprises
                                Immobilidres et de Travanx ware to realize to day their portion of
                                the property, the sale would net them a clear £18 000, and this on
                                an expendi-ture of £7,500 made last June. As no doubt the property
                                will be disposed of at a more advantageous figure, a considerably
                                larger profit will result therefrom.</p>

                            <p>"Autres temps, autres mceurs"; old de Riverolles tale of the Middle
                                Ages seems now hardly more antiquated than Dumas 20 year-old play
                                itself. By so much have we progressed or—become blaze. And,
                                paradoxically, "plus ca change plus c’est la meme chose; there is
                                the usual triangle, this time an isosceles one, its sides composed
                                of suspicions of husband and wife married "a outrance” on a very
                                weak basis of infidelity, and the denonement no less laborious than
                                the Pons Asinorum. We hardly care to think how a Dumas of to-day
                                would fare with a piece whose meagre plot and interminable dialogues
                                are equalled only by its want of plausibility and action. The
                                constant repetition of the main theme by nearly every character soon
                                becomes tedious. There is hero and there a redeeming epigram, but on
                                the whole the play offers little opportunity, nor did we think that,
                                when produced on Saturday, that little was pushed to its uttermost
                                possibility. Even Mile Marthe Brandes in the title idle did not mark
                                her debut in Alexandria with anything beyond an averagely good
                                performance. For this, no doubt a severe cold, from which she was
                                suffering, was in a measure responsible. And then the part is wordy
                                and refitted and hence deprives its interpreter of a good deal of
                                the effect to be gained by appeals to the imagination. It may well
                                be that a stage idea of the 'femme du monde' is to keep the emotions
                                genteelly in check; still there was surely room for rather more
                                colour and "abandon’’ in "Francillon" than Mile Brandis imparted.
                                Setting aside M Arnaud, the present troupe is certainly better than
                                Mme Hading’s com-pany, in that they shew confidence and pull well
                                together. On Saturday no one player stood out from amongst the
                                others, so it would be invidious to draw distinctions. This evening,

                            <p>CEREMONY AT THE CITADEL</p>
                            <p>Topped by the mosque and ifs minarets, the Citadel stands clear
                                against the sky: the blood , red standard scarce flatters in the
                                morning breeze, and the ramparts are fringed will an evergrowing
                                line of figures, clad in every abade of ooloar but mostly capped
                                with crimson tarboosh. The crowd in the place below grows denser
                                every moment as the morning mists roll away and carriage after
                                carriage flits its way into the enclosure. For civilized and
                                Europeanized as is our Cairo, this great festival, centred round the
                                departure of the Holy Carpet for Mecca, is still one of the great
                                events of the calendar and is eagerly awaited by both Mohamedan and
                                Christian. The night before its departure the heavily embroidered
                                panels and the sacred Mahmal were 'en evidence'. under cover, and
                                great was the crowd that circled round it and joined the audience in
                                the adjoining tent where Dervishes chanted their endless verses, and
                                devotees persisted in their devotions till the onlookers grew weary
                                of the drowsy monotony and strange barbaric musical intervals. But
                                the morning ceremony held under the blue canopy of heaven and with
                                accompaniment of military display appeals more to the ordinary
                                observer and bolds attention from first to last. The native crowd,
                                so full of colour and movement, the mounted police reducing chaos
                                into semblance ,of order, the stretch of sand-covered road winding
                                round the Citadel and up the slope beyond, the wide parade ground
                                lined with rigid troops, and the constant stream of carriages and
                                people, keep eyes and senses always on the alert. High officials,
                                gorgeous in their gold-laced uniforms, with brightly coloured orders
                                and glittering decorations, whirl by; and also many native
                                notabilities in wonderful eastern garb and flowing garments of
                                various hues with embroideries of gold about their necks and
                                encircling their turbans. Some drive in state behind proudly
                                stepping horses; others arrive in humble arabeshs, the effect made
                                grotesque at times by the figure of a ragged urchin taking a free
                                ride behind. Closed broughams flash by containing visions of veiled
                                ladies of state, and the latest arrivals from England in the latest
                                thing in motor cars presses largely to the fore. But all are ready
                                in their places, and all the soldiers spick and span and well to
                                attention before the clatter of the Lancer escort proclaims the
                                arrival of H.H. the Khedive and his entourage in the highly swung
                                barouche with syces and outriders. The strains of the National
                                Anthem, Royal salutes, and shouts from the male population greet his
                                arrival, while the curious twittering cries from the native women
                                add an element most curious and unusual to the sound. In the
                                meanwhile the Kiewet el-Mahmal has been borne into the centre of the
                                ground : the ' gorgeous tent-like creation has been already lifted
                                into position upon the honoured camel, all richly caparisoned and
                                almost covered with its saddle cloth and headpiece of gold and
                                crimson. The Mahmal itself is so overladen with heavy gold and
                                silver bullion that scarce any of its crimson ground is visible.
                                High silver ornaments are at its angles, its silver apex gleams from
                                under a falling fringe of black. Swaying to the movement of the
                                camel it scintillates and blazons in the sunshine and moves slowly
                                across the ground past the Khedive, and starts the first stage of
                                its long and weary journey followed by the plaintive music of flats
                                and native drum. Stretched on long domed frames of wood, and looking
                                for all the world like enormous ambulance litters, follow the
                                various portions of the sacred carpet. They are carried on the
                                stalwart shoulders of duffel clad gaffirs; and while some are
                                covered, all with black, others display their glittering ,
                                inscriptions from the Koran upon a ground of black or green. After
                                them stream the various regiments : first the Lancers with their
                                band playing, somewhat inappropriately,very English music, then the
                                guns of the field battery and the mule battery, and after them
                                detachments of the Egyptian line. After the long stream has passed
                                away out of sight and the final salute is over, the Khe-dive drives
                                off in his state carriage across the ground, and the great function
                                is over. Within half an hour the crowd has drifted back to its
                                highways and byeways, and the Citadel is once more left to keep
                                solitary watch and ward over the town at its feet.</p>

                                Saturday afternoon, at Moharem Bey, under the direction of Miralai
                                Hockinson, deserved the highest praise. But more than this. The
                                feature that stood forth most conspicuously, at that exhibition,was
                                neither the excellency of the equipment, nor the superior make of
                                the machinery ; it was rather, if the writer’s allegory may be
                                permitted, (he high standard of efficiency of the "human machine”—
                                effi cient in every detail of the manifold duties involved in the

                                engine may be perfect, hot it is after all the man behind it that
                                tells. The brigade whom Superintendent Waller marshalled on Saturday
                                before his Excellency the Governor and a goodly gathering of local
                                portabilities—official and civilian- were as fine a body of men as
                                one could wish to see ; splendid physique, and for all their swarthy
                                faces, very imposing in their dazzling brass helme’s. There were a
                                promptitude to obey and enthusiasm in action which augur well, and
                                it was also not a little gratifying to note the keen delight shown
                                by the native population, a huge concourse of whom covered the steep
                                slope of Kom el Dik; they were especially jubilant over the
                                operations for rescuing one of their own kith and kin,who his bare
                                and puny legs swinging in the wind, was let down from the top storey
                                window. The display commenced with inspection parade of brigade and
                                equipment, consisting of three fire engines, one automobile; a
                                manual engine ; pompier ladder; long ladder; and hose reel. To avoid
                                tediousness, we will con-fine ourselves to a generalisation of the
                                several , items of the programme. The drilling was , perfect, and
                                the record of time in which the work was carried out, remarkable.
                                For instance the manual engine was got in'o action, pump pipe, and
                                all, by one man within 1.41 minutes. The pompier ladder, whose uses
                                were next demonstrated, is, we believe, a French invention ; the
                                books at the end of the short ladders employed in climbing from
                                storey to storey reminded one of the fore feet of that interesting
                                invertebrate, the Walking Stick insect Reaching the top of one
                                ladder, the fireman secured himself by a catch to the sill, while he
                                fixed on the ladder he carried to the upper floor; the rungs were
                                attached to a centre—piece like fish- bones to the spine, and the
                                saw—like appearance made one shudder. The rope used in the escape is

                                light and thin, but of immense strength. We had also a practical
                                demonstration of the water curtain, which so ingeniously protects
                                the fireman by a circular spray at right angles to the jet The
                                chemical cylinder, containing carbonic acid gas, that rapidly
                                extinguished a fierce fire, and the smoke helmet, were also
                                interesting. The long ladder is eighty feet in length. At full span,
                                it looks top heavy, but except for an initial list, the carriage on
                                which it stands scarcely creaked, no matter what way the ladder was
                                turned. It is of German manu- factors, built by Honig of Cologne,
                                and not the latest thing in ladders, for by the newest invention the
                                fireman is winched up by a motor engine. But for Alexandria, which
                                at present is free of sky scraping architecture, the German
                                apparatus will suffice. The motor fire engine was, as with the
                                others, constructed by the well known firm of Merryweather of London
                                ; it was oonverted to automobility recently by an expert sent from

                                instantaneously, even at full gallop. The "house on fire” scene was
                                the grande finale, most realistic with just a suspicion of smoke
                                —the spectators would have bean delighted with a good old blaze but
                                proximity to the station buildings forbade ; or perhaps the house
                                was too wet After the gallop past the parade reformed, and his
                                Excellency the Governor congratulated Superintendent Waller and his
                                men on their admirable performance.</p>

                                Valentine. If the whole performance had not tailed off so wretchedly
                                we should have appreciated them. Mile Baron can act; and it is the
                                greatest possible relief to see a Marguerite who has any notion of
                                acting. The "Thole” song was perhaps her best achievement. The
                                tremolo—wh'ch she uses far too much—came in as a "roucoulement”—a
                                real spinning-wheel song. crooned to herself. The Jewel song would
                                hare been even better, but she spoilt it by a "show” high note at
                                the end which dramatised her soliloqoy out of its proper form Her
                                acting was especially good in the church scene with Mephistopheles:
                                many slight touches, her concentration on the mass-book from which
                                her thoughts were so far absent, her painful progress across the
                                stage kneeling— these and much else proved her merit but her voice
                                seems tired, and now and again she uses that tremolo to avoid an
                                awkward semitone or accidental. M. Maas was not bad, but seemed to
                                have bad quite enongh of the play long before the end. M. Mezy has
                                little enough to do, but his voice is good, with plenty of strength
                                and far more 'colour' than those of the others. M. Fontaine, I was
                                told, had been suffering from dengue. He must have had it from the
                                beginning of the season than ; he showed the same tendency to force
                                his notes, especially in the lower register, as he did in ‘Manon'
                                and "Romeo and Juliette.” It is a pity, as his higher, more
                                emotional notes are the "real thing." But why does he make up so
                                badly! He always appears grotesque with that absurd beard and
                                moustache arrangement In "Manon," after the first two acts he was
                                well made up, and naturally; and it made all the difference in the
                                world. Siebel (Mile Karl) and Marthe (Mile Burizy) were fair. The
                                chorus end orchestra were very bad : the former were stiff, and at
                                best noisy, and in the soldiers' chorus they looked like a lot of
                                gaffiers on parade. The latter, as I have already said, seems to be
                                always asleep and flat. The conductor has no sort of entrain. He
                                gets through it all anyhow and never makes a point of any sort. No
                                wonder the operas go badly! The famous Escalais appears at length in

                                in its more serious aspect. Let us hope for a vivid and striking
                                contrast to the first few efforts. It is, I think, no use people
                                talking (as I have heard and read lately) about the small Opera
                                House, the difficulties, etc, etc. I can't see any sort of excuse
                                for the shortcomings. We need not expect Caruso and Melba, but
                                surely the receipts end whatever help the company get should ensure
                                at least a really good second-class troupe. Really, when one is
                                driven to indulgence in comparison with the Abbas and ci-devantt
                                Verdi Theatres, with any stage where any singing can be heard, one

                                Mezy. Mass, and Mile Devilloy are all four, of a different class to
                                any we have yet heard : they are grand opera, and very good grand
                                opera at that. M. Escalais has a great resonant voice : his high
                                notes are those of a clarion shaking and echoing through the house;
                                his diction and declamation are those of a great singer. Of course
                                his acting and, in a sense, some of his singing are entirely
                                stereotyped and traditional: be is, except for those high notes, a
                                type and not an individual He sang rather flat now and again in the
                                lower and middle registers and was inclined to skirt round the note
                                ; and in those same registers was a suspicion of wear and tear and
                                effort His finest singing was in the duet with Mathilde. the
                                "J'expire" and the trio, and the two songs in the last act, “Mes
                                ami." and ‘’Asile muet” M. Mass was more at home than as
                                Mephistopheres, and the depth and "roundness" of his voice had foull
                                scope. M. Mezy though, was the triumph of the evening. His voice, a
                                great baritone, had every shade of strength and colour and drama :
                                and his acting was equally fine and not nearly so strewed as that of
                                the rest. Mile Deviloy had not half enough to do, from our point of
                                view. She is, I really think, the most perfect of the sopranos. She
                                has far more tone than Mile Baron, and though she has hardly the
                                training of Mile Charpentier, her voice is infinitely sweeter: never
                                a disagreeable or harsh note, or a shadow of fatigue or thinness,
                                and her notes were sweetness itself. Those phases of the opera I
                                have mentioned, -and I add Mezy's singing and acting before
                                "Gessler”—were as near perfection as could be. As for the rest, the
                                orchestra did the overtore well, and kept to a fairly good standard
                                most of the time ; but in the trio— Walther, Arnold and Guillaume
                                Tell—it was again shaky and inaccurate. The players do not respond
                                enough. Mile Karl acted well all through, but her singing lacks
                                certainty : she never seems sure of herself or her voice. M. Durand
                                looked like Henry VIII. in a most tyrannical "get-up," and sang well
                                enough. The others one may as well pass over. The chorus must have a
                                special condemnation. The breakdown in the 3rd act, the general
                                tuneless-ness and carelessness seem to show an entire lack of
                                drilling or training. I admit most of them seemed to know it, and to
                                be sorry for what was probably not their fault; but one or two of
                                the worst offenders (I think they were in last year’s chorus) seemed
                                hopelessly satisfied with themselves and stared and sang into
                                vacancy with the most deplorable aplomb. Of ballets, I am no judge :
                                opinions seemed to differ; but certainly I am thankful in that the
                                vision of fleshly poetry of motion caused one worthy at least behind
                                me to stop making horrible noises with programme, feet, throat, and
                                other accessories that were not meant by the Creator as annoyances
                                to one's fellow-creatures! At one moment I would have given much for
                                a powerful and wide-spreading narcotic for use in the stalls.</p>
