                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                    scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                    in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>RECKLESS RHETORIC.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Victor Grayson, one of those members of Parliament who desire to pose as
                    upholders of the rights of the Egyptians to self-government, recently indulged at
                    Hudderfield in a violent attack on Lord Cromer. Referring to the recent money grant made to
                    that distinguished servant of the State, Mr. Grayson said that "the national exchequer had
                    been depleted to fill the maw of an idle and cruel parasite, who was a curse to the race."
                    Never, we imagine, did public speaker offer greater insult to any man, and never was
                    uttered a bigger falsehood or more cruel slander. Surely Mr. Grayson does not think that by
                    using such repulsive phraseology he is helping those whose interests he pretends to have at
                    heart! Surely he can see that by such abusive rhetoric he is harming those whom he would
                    have the world believe he is helping! It is amply evident that such men as Mr. Grayson 
                    are but using the advanced Nationalist party of Egypt as a cats-paw to obtain their own end--
                    a notoriety which would be a disgrace to any man of sincere feeling and true patriotism.
                    The most rapid Anglophobes of this country have never gone so far, even in their most
                    heated moments, to describe Lord Comer as "an idle and cruel parasite," and while decrying
                    his work they confess that it was he who brought riches to the country. Lord Cromer was
                    throughout his career, and is still in his hour of rest, the most devoted friend which Egypt
                    has ever claimed, and during his many years of public life he has proved himself, as a 
                    servant to the vast Empire to which he belongs and for which he has striven, unsurpassed in
                    faithfulness. Lord Cromer, lifted the yoke of slavery from the necks of the Egyptians and
                    gave them liberty; he it was who made a bankrupt country rich; to him is due the suppression
                    of bribery and corruption; he is responsible for the reformation of the country's
                    courts and the administration of justice. For such services, for such unparalleled works of wonder,
                    we might say, Lord Cromer is help up to public opprobrium by a youthful M.P.,
                    whose ignorance is only deserving of the infants school. But Lord Cromer can afford to disregard
                    the reckless, meaningless rhetoric of an ignorant youth, who has no yet learnt the
                    lesson of self control. He is conscious of the good work which he has done during his long
                    career, and he knows that those of worth and sound judgment, those who have followed the
                    trend of events with an unbiassed mind, and those for whom he has worked are filled with
                    the greatest admiration for his services.</p>

                    <p>Referring to the telegram which we publish under this heading on page 5, the statement
                    of the German newspaper apparently is due to the allegation made by a French newspaper
                    recently to the effect that Germany, in view of the present unfavourable condition of her
                    money market, is not in a position to bear the cost of a war. The latest mail from Europe
                    brings a leading article from the "Cologne Gazette," which is said to be semi-officially
                    inspired and headed "Preparedness for War," where these statements of the Parisian Press are opposed. The journal says:-
                    "It would be regrettable if by such false reports doubts as to Germany's military power and preparedness for war were to arise. A
                    belief in this readiness is essential to the support of peace; therefore in the interests of
                    peace such attempts to undermine it are very reprehensible. In 1870 the strength of Germany's finances
                    could not be in any way compared with those which, thanks to the economical
                    development and growing wealth of the country, she has at her disposal to-day. What we could
                    do then we can do to-day in increased measure; if we are now in a position to raise the
                    necessary money for our economic aims by ourselves, neither should we be obliged in time
                    of war to appeal to foreign countries. All concern about raising money should be tranquilly
                    left to us We can have nothing against French newspapers warning their fellow-countrymen
                    against investing their money in German stock; they can keep it or not as they like. We can maintain a calm front towards
                    such counsel; but it seems not only useless, but, for general considerations, not a little dangerous to
                    represent Germany's monetary position as so wretched as to annul the aims of national defence."</p>

                    The story of Cinderella had its counterpart in the land of the pyramids. From time immemorial Egyptian mothers had told their children how a beautiful peasant-girl,
                    while bathing in the Nile, was robbed of her slipper by an eagle. The slipper was taken to the King's palace, and the King-
                    the builder of one of the great pyramids-sought for its wearer and made her his Queen.</p>

                    <head>THE LAMBERT AFFAIR</head>
                    <p>ACCUSATIONS AGAINST MR. DUNLOP.</p>
                    <p>Our Cairo Correspondent writes:-M. Lambert's recent letter to the "Temps," in which he
                    attacked the Adviser to the Ministry of Public Instruction together with all his works,
                    with so much vehemence, is still the subject of much comment in Cairo. It is felt that the
                    letter is too serious to be allowed to pass unnoticed, the differences of opinion, which
                    according to M. Lambert existed between himself and the Adviser, are often inevitable in so
                    far as they concern the organization of a large department, but M. Lambert has done more
                    than differ with his chief on matters such as these, he has formulated direct accusations of
                    tyranny and corruption against Mr. Dunlop which call for an equally direct reply. Mr.
                    Dunlop in refusing to make any communication to the press on the subject has only been
                    following one of his well-known principals; it matters little what form his reply make take,
                    provided that a definite answer is made.</p>
                    <p>The Nationalist, and a portion of the French Press have naturally seized upon the incident
                    with avidity, and in order to combat the damaging influences which it may have made
                    upon that portion of the community which is always lying in wait for an excuse to display
                    its disloyality, it is necessary that the person most directly concerned should make public
                    his side of the questions, when we have no doubt but what a very different aspect of the affair would be seen,
                    and the mountains of the moment would develop into the proverbial mole hill in the end. It is really astonishing
                    that a gentleman of M. Lambert's susceptibility could have remained in such a cesspool of corruption as longas he did.</p>
                    <p>The question of education, where it bears particularly upon the teaching of one language
                    in preference to that of another, is almost bound to create feelings of dissent, if not of
                    bitterness, between the representatives of the countries involved; and Mr. Lambert would
                    have been more than human if the evident passing away of French as a national language
                    had no occasioned him a pang of regret. He speaks with real bitterness of Mr. Dunlop's
                    anti French programme. Take the facts of the position into review however and it will be
                    evident to all, that such changes in the allocation of time to othe teaching of English
                    as opposed to French, were made, not as M. Lambert appears to imagine for the sole
                    purpose of humiliating the French people, but for the simple reason that such changes were
                    absolutely necessary, if the Egyptians were to profit by the British occupation. The British
                    are in the country as-let us say-guardians of the welfare of the people, training its
                    officers both military and civil under men of our own nationality, what then could be more
                    necessary than that the people should be given every facility of learning the language of its
                    tutors, in order that they may more readily assimilate the ideas and customs which they are
                    called upon to learn. It would be a very strange policy to follow if the British having
                    administered the country for years, should shew no desire to render such administration
                    more easy, and at the same time more effective by extending as far as possible the knowledge
                    of the tounge in which the administrative changes have been wrought.</p>
                    <p>The increased number of Egyptians who speak the English language is becoming more
                    noticeable every year, while on the other hand there is no appreciable decrease in the number
                    who speak French, the reason being that French still holds its way as the conversational
                    language while English is learnt by the newer generation of officials. There is not the slightest
                    wish on the part of the British to oust the French language from the position which it
                    has held for years, but there is the desire to make the knowledge of English as general as
                    possible, and such a desire is in the interests of the Egyptians and of their country.</p>
                    <p>So much for the reasons which prompted Mr. Dunlop to act as he did in question where
                    French or English had to be decided upon, for the rest the charges made by M. Lambert are mainly of a personal
                    nature and the reply to them must needs be of the same description.</p>

                    Thomas Cook and Son in the Avenue de l'Opera, says the "Express." Mr. Ellis, who fifty seven years of age, was a member of
                    the great engineering firm of John Aird and Sons, and directed much of the work connected with the building of the gigantic dam at Assouan.</p>

                    <p>Sharia-el-Manakh, Cairo, is shortly to be the scene of a great deal of building. Soliman el Ghoudi Bey has decided to erect a large block
                    of buildings and shops, seven stories high, near the National Hotel. The building will contain twenty residential flats and ten shops.
                    It is situated at the corner of Sharia Soliman Pasha and Sharia el-Manakh and is be be finished within a year. Mr. Robert Williams, F. R. I. B. A., is the architect.</p>

                    <head>RAILWAY BUILDING DEFECTS.</head>
                    <p>The Railway Administration has once more been unfortunate in its choice of contractors for
                    its building work. The new mechanical quarters in Cairo have been built on foundations guaranteed for
                    a period of 10 years by a certain firm of contractors and now that the building is complete
                    it is found that the foundation is faulty and the whole will have to be rebuilt. The railway will
                    of course suffer in as much as it will have to wait for new quarters, but speaking financially it will not be
                    the looser. There have been complaints also regarding the concrete which was used at the new Minieh station. This however
                    was done when it was found necessary to build another station there. The only place which offered a suitable site was on the old canal,
                    and this though of necessity an extremely bad place for foundations was eventually decided upon, knowing
                    however that there was bound to be a certain amount of sinking, concrete of an inferior kind
                    was put in for the time being, and this, owing to the platform having settled as it was expected to do,
                    is now cracking and is abortly to be replaced by concrete of a good quality.</p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,-In Lord Cromer's last report a note by Sir Horace Pinching, the then Director
                    General of the Public Health Department, appeared wherein that high official raised the
                    hopes of the numerous residents of this salubrious suburb by stating that "Belouan will be
                    furnished with a Jewell filter plant during 1907." Up to the present there is not the
                    slightest sign of any such installation and our water supply at the present time is rich in
                    mud and slime. In fact, the water here is worse than it has  been for several years. These
                    ingredients in our water may no doubt be excellent for an agricultural district from the
                    point of view of deposit, but in as much as Helouan has no claim to being an agricultural
                    region, but is simply and solely a residential town we have no need for such ingredients in our water
                    supply. I may state the evil conditions of our water in many cases impart a perceptible flavour to our fluid.</p>

                    <p>All the home newspapers of last Monday devote considerable space to obituary notices
                    of Lord Brampton, better known to the English public as Sir Henry Hawkins. Yet Reuters
                    Agency neglected to send a word announcing his death. It will be remembered that the same
                    Agency did no give us the news of the deaths of either Ruskin or Herbert Spencer. Yet
                    over and over again the demise of quite unknown persons is announced. For example
                    on Saturday morning Reuter's Agency announced that the French Senator Hugo had died. The deceased
                    gentleman appears to be quite unknown to fame and a French Cairo contemporary is at a loss to identify him and exclaims:-</p>
                    <p>L'agence Reuter nous annonce gravement aujourd'hui que M. Hugo, senateur, est mort a Milan on
                    ailleurs en Italie, mais elle neglige de nous dire ce que pouvait bien faire de son
                    vivant l'illustre defunt quit mague son nom celebre de l'autre cote des Aples, est totalement
                    inconnu de ses compatriotes en Egypte. Il est vrai qu'a la foire il y a plus d'un ane qui s'appelle Martin.</p>
                    <p>D'autre part, on nous suggere que ce nom de Hygo pourrait bien n'etre que le prenom du defunt
                    senateur, et que le nom de famille a du rester au bout du fil; cela n'aurait rien d'extraordinaire
                    pour qui connalt le soin apporte par nos ineffables agences a la transmission de leurs depeches.</p>

                    <head>OMDURMAN MARKET.</head>
                    <p>The Governor of Khartoum met with a number of the leading merchants of Omdurman
                    at the Zabtiah last Thursday morning. The building up of the new market ws among the principal matters
                    considered. It was decided that the floors of the shops to be build should be 30 centimetres above the level of the street,
                    the object being to avoid the inundation of the shops during the rainy season.</p>
                    <p>The Governor announced that after full consulation with the Works Department, it was
                    found that the projected water-works could not be completed before next April. Special
                    arrangements have therefore to be made for supplying the water needed for building. A contract
                    will be made with some individuals who will agree to erect one or more pumps over some
                    public well in the neighbourhood of the market place, and sell the water at certain
                    rates to be agreed upon by the contractor and the local authorities.</p>
                    <p>One of the merchants present called the attention of the Mudir to the fact that though
                    the ownership of many pieces of land in Omdurman has already be settled no titles
                    have yet been given to the proprietors; and if any of them wish to sell or mortgage their
                    lands, as it often seems advisable or unavoidable, they are unable to do so for lack of
                    proper documents. It was pointed out, however, that parties interested may apply to the
                    Survey Officer at Omdurman, and upon payment of a fee of five shillings, a title for the land
                    together with a plan showing its dimensions and boundaries will be given to the applicant.

                    <p>Dr. Hamy, on retiring from the presidency of the Society of Anthropology of Paris, delivered
                    a lecture on the human figure in the monuments of ancient Egypt. The proto-Egyptian
                    figures in ivory and terra-cotta are described as of a modest, rustic, and popular type of art.
                    Those of the earlier dynasties of Manetho are more simple and more refined. Dr. Hamy
                    maintains his opinion as to the persistence of type between the ancient mummy portraits and the fellaheen
                    of our own day. He adduced in evidence the famous wooden figure called the Sheik-el-Beled, and
                    discusses in detail several of the cast of sculptures made by Prof. Flinders Petrie for the British
                    Association Committee, comparing them with modern types. He comments on the ethnographic value of the portrait
                    figures of men of other nations in captivity, as representing various African types.</p>

                    plusieurs valeurs ont meme beneficie d'une nouvelle avance, qui a ete pour quelqies unes
                    fort appreciable. Dans l'empomble, pourtant, on s'a ttendait a mieax et la vlotute, un pea plus
                    faible que le debut, a ete une desillusion pour un certain nombre. Inutile d'ajouter que les
                    transactions sout reateas clarsombeset limited en comme importance a quatre ou cinq valeurs.
