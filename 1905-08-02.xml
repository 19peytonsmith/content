                        <p>SALES OF SUDAN LANDS.</p>
                        <p>Though a certain amount of annoyance may be caused by the recent decree
                            of the Sudan Government forbidding sales of land by natives without the
                            consent of the pro- vincial governors, we are convinced that the measure
                            is, in the main, both wise and just. The Egyptian and British
                            Governments have not occupied the Sudan solely with a view to their own
                            profit, nor do they intend to permit strangers to buy up valuable lands
                            for a song and oust native proprietors from their holdings by taking
                            advantage of their embarrassments We are prepared to hear severe
                            criticisms passed by interested in- dividuals on the action of the Sudan
                            author ities. They will be accused of restricting trade, restraining
                            free commercial intercourse, inter- fering with free contracts, and so
                            forth ad nauseam, but their detractors will find it hard to explain why
                            a Government, which exists ostensibly for the benefit of the Sudanese,
                            should not interfere in contracts in which one of the parties is as a
                            rule an astute and esurient foreigner, the other dusky gentleman without
                            sufficient foresight to look beyond the day after to-morrow, and without
                            the knowledge that might otherwise enable him to obtain a fair price for
                            his hands. In our opinion tie Sudan Government has only done its duty in
                            checking or regulating sales which might have unpleasant results in the
                            future. The Sudanese who parts with his lands for a trifle to-day, and
                            is content with the trifle, will be the first to complain when he
                            realises to-morrow that be has made a bad bargain, and being of a
                            hot-tempered and somewhat fanatical nature, may attempt to settle
                            accounts vi et arms. That a number of European landlords, com- pelled by
                            the climate to be absentees for half the year, should become owners of
                            the greater part of the tillable areas of the Sudan, is not the
                            intention of the Government, whose in- terests will not be served by
                            agrarian quarrels between natives and Europeans or by the speculative
                            purchase of lands by individuals who cannot develop them. We have no
                            doubt that certain large areas which require irriga- tion or reclamation
                            on a scale that is far beyond the means of the small proprietor will
                            fall into European hands, and see no reason why they should not. There
                            are likely to be several Kom Ombos in Senaar and the Ghazireh Province,
                            concessions that can only be deve- loped by the expenditure of large
                            sums that are likely enough to run into six or even seven figures, but
                            we do not imagine that the Sudan Government intends to allow every petty
                            trader who has entered the country to offer derisory sums to natives for
                            lands that he hopes to sell at fifteen or twenty times their cost price.
                            The days are past when Govern- mets permitted the hardy pioneer to
                            acquire gold miner or fat acres of arable land with the expenditure of a
                            few hawks bells and beads, with a little rum and calico thrown in. </p>

                            shall take place on the 1st of October, and that the Assembly hall meet
                            on the 1st of November. The sitting will be private, but the president

                        <p>Big Fire at Assiout. — Our Assiout Correspondent writes:—On Sunday night
                            a big fire broke out in the house of Khashaba Bey, one of the wealthiest
                            men in Assiout. The outbreak was due to the fact that a small boy, six
                            years old, had set fire to a curtain and left it burning as if nothing
                            had happened. Nobody noticed anything until the whole house was ablaze.
                            The Inspector of the Interior happened to be at Assiout and worked hard
                            in trying to subdue the flames, together with the wekil of the moudirieh
                            and the hukumdar; but the conflagration continued for about fourteen
                            hours. They, however, succeeded in confining it to the house where it
                            broke out. The damage is estimated at £16,000.</p>
                        <p>Where to go in the Summer Evenings.— We need not remind our readers that
                            one of the greatest sights of Egypt is that of the Pyramids, especially
                            by moonlight. A great want has been filled by the establishment of a bar
                            and restaurant there,and visitors all testify to the excellent
                            arrangements that have been made for catering to their wants at this
                            rather out-of-the-way spot. The “Pyramids Bar and Restaurant,” situated
                            opposite Mena House Hotel and at the foot of the Pyramids, is a place
                            where one can obtain everything one requires to satisfy the “inner man”
                            at very reasonable rates. A sure guarantee that all the mineral waters,
                            wines, spirits, beers, etc., retailed at this bar and restaurant are of
                            the best quality, is the fact that they are supplied by Mr. N. Spathis,
                            the well-known merchant and mineral water manufacturer. [Advt.]</p>
                        <p>The Gardner-Brown Troupe. —The Gard- ner-Brown variety company is at
                            present per- forming nightly at the Alcazar Music-hall in Cairo, where
                            it has met with such success that Mr. Gardner-Brown has decided that his
                            company shall remain in Cairo until the middle of September, when they
                            will continue on their way to India. The Sisters Romaine, of whom Cairo
                            music-hall goers retain pleasant recollec- tions from their performances
                            here last year, form the chief attraction of the troupe. These two young
                            comediennes sing duets of lighter vein with great “verve” and also dance
                            grace- fully, and the audience is always reluctant to let them leave the
                            stage. Mr. Leo Montague is an excellent comedian, sings well, dances
                            well, and does not indulge in vulgarity which is so much in evidence on
                            the music-hall stage. Mr. Geo. Montague is most amusing and clever in
                            his ventriloquial efforts and is always greet- -ed with much applause.
                            Mr. Gardner-Brown himself provides an excellent Bioscope “show,” and
                            Mrs. Gardner-Brown sings a number of well-known songs, which are
                            illustrated by lantern-slides, in a very pleasing manner. It is
                            necessary to point Out to the management of this music-hall that a very
                            great improvement in the playing of the band is to be desired. Not
                            content with playing out of tune to such a degree as to jar upon the
                            nerves of every mu- sical and unmusical person in the hall, the members
                            of this band,consisting of more than a dozen, absolutely disregard each
                            other’s efforts and so fail entirely in combination. In addi- tion to
                            these two unpardonable sins, of neither of which any band, pretentious
                            of a Knowledge of music should be guilty, they greatly depre- ciate the
                            efforts of the artistes by playing so loudly that one has to strain
                            one’s ears in order to hear the sounds proceeding from the stage. It
                            would be well for the band-conductor to bear in mind that the audience
                            is desirous of hear- ing the performers and can have but little interest

                        <p>JUDGMENT AGAIN UPHELD.</p>
                        <p>The Court of Cassation, consisting of Ahmed Bey Afifi, president, Yehia
                            Bey Ibrahim, Youssef Bey Chawky, Ahmed Bey Chawky, 1 Ahmed Bey Helmi,
                            and Mr. Halton, sat yesterday morning to hear the appeal lodged by
                            Hassan Bey Wassif, Moudir of Ghirgeh, against the sentence passed by the
                            Criminal Court of Appeal on June 29, by which Hassan Bey Wassif, the
                            Cadi, and the clerk of Badawi Bey Rifaa were condemned to two years’
                            imprisonment and the two witnesses to the alleged forgery were each
                            sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>The office of counsel for the prosecution was filled by Ali Bey Abou El
                            Fatouh, while the defendants were represented in Court by their
                            advocates, among them Omar Bey Loutfi, Skander Bey Ammoun, and other
                            well-known members of the Cairo Bar.</p>
                        <p>After the Court had refused the coun- sel for the prosecution’s demand to
                            produce a letter of Hassan Bey Wassif in Court, the case for the
                            prosecution was heard. At 10.30 a.m. the Court retired for a quarter of
                            an hour, and on the resumption of the sitting Omar Bey Loufti pleaded
                            the cause of the ex-moudir. The principal heads of his defence
                            were:-</p>
                        <p>(1.) The copies of conclusions of counsel for complainant and the
                            voluminous written pleadings of the Parquet had not been served on
                            counsel for the defendant till one day previous to the hearing, and the
                            Court had refused to allow an adjournment to enable the defence to
                            prepare a reply.</p>
                        <p> (2.) The Court had not given counsel for the defence sufficient time to
                            finish his pleading before it rose.</p>
                        <p>(3.) After the judgment of the Assiout Court Badawi Bey Rifaa had
                            admitted before wit- nesses that he had signed the power of attorney
                            with full knowledge of the facts and had denied the fact, by alleging
                            that he had been imposed upon, at the instigation of a relative in whose
                            house he had been staying.</p>
                        <p>(4.) After judgment of First Instance had been delivered the Parquet
                            filed in the dossier of the case a letter calculated to influence the
                            judges in their opinion of one of the items of evidence for the
                            prosecution, and that this letter was filed without giving notice
                            thereof, to the defendants or their counsel.</p>
                        <p>After hearing Omar Bey Loufti’s defence and that of counsel for the
                            remainder of the accused, the Court retired to consider its verdict and
                            1.35 p.m. returned and gave its decision rejecting the appeal.</p>

                        <p> A RIDICULOUS STORY.</p>
                        <p>A very extraordinary version of the Hamade incident has found its way
                            into certain French and German contemporaries, who state that Sheikh
                            Hamade was arrested under the belief that he bore a proclamation from
                            the late Grand Mufti of Egypt announcing that the Turks were no longer
                            worthy to hold the Caliphate and, so to speak, excommunicating the
                            Sultan. We need not say that there is not a word of truth in this
                            ridiculous story, which has probably been sent on its travels by an
                            opponent of the late Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, whose whole life makes his
                            participation in an Arab conspiracy abso- lutely unthinkable.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Meshaka of Cairo writes:- Allow me to bring to your notice the
                            following. I had occa- sion to have under my care a few cases apparently
                            similar to the suspicious choleraic cases reported in Luxor a few weeks
                            ago. They resemble cholera in having a severe onset, severe colic, and
                            the other usual symptoms, with great dejection; but here the similarity
                            ends. In about three or four hours or more the symptoms abate and the
                            case takes a favora- ble turn, while on the following day the patient
                            very possibly goes to work, only a little depressed and weak. The
                            lighter cases are much more numerous, and need no special reference,
                            except that most take the same Course as the first. In all the worst
                            cases, and in most of the light ones, I have found that eating prawns
                            lies at the root of the evil. Vendors care little whether their prawns
                            are fresh and good, or old and putrid, as long as they sell; and since
                            nobody else cares either, the poor folk are allowed to be poisoned.</p>

                            by Europeans and natives. The arrangements made by the police outside

                        <p>Dear Sir,—In regard to Ramleh bathing I confess to having read the
                            complaint of “Mer- maid” with astonishment. She must be a prude. What
                            can be more picturesque than the brown colour of the bodies of bathing
                            natives? It is a fine sight to see them swim- ming, and I am always glad
                            to see that they like their seabaths. They never molest bathing and

                        <p>OPENING OF RAILWAY.</p>
                        <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                        <p> Nicosia, July 27.</p>
                        <p> The temperature during the last week has been somewhat higher in the
                            plains, ranging up to 102° and 103° Fahrenheit in the shade. </p>
                        <p>The formal opening of the Cyprus Govern- ment Railway will not take place
                            until some time in the autumn, when the Government returns to Nicosia.
                            The line will, however, be open to traffic from the 1st proximo between
                            Nicosia and Famagusta. Steady pro- gress is being made with the
                            construction of the line between Nicosia and Morphou, a distance of some
                            24 miles. It is greatly to be hoped that money will be forthcoming to
                            make it possible to extend that portion of the line as far as
                            Karavostassi, a distance of 12 miles beyond Morphou. Karavostassi is a
                            small natural harbour in the south bend of Morphou Bey, and a
                            considerable quantities of goods are regularly shipped from there to
                            Alexandria and other places. It is the nearest and most convenient
                            shipping place for the whole of that locality, embracing Morphou, Lefka,
                            and the lovely Marathassa Valley. Karavostassi receives for shipment
                            every year several million oranges and lemons from Lefka, and large
                            consignments of fruit and vegetables from the other two places.</p>
                        <p>WELCOME INNOVATIONS.</p>
                        <p>There is some talk of the establishment of a creamery and ice-making
                            factory near Nicosia. It is a much needed want. It is almost im-
                            possible to obtain good fresh butter—certainly not through the
                            summer—and cream and cheese made by modern methods, and with improved
                            appliances, are also difficult to get. I have alluded before now to the
                            lack of ice and refrigerating facilities, and if Nicosia wishes to be
                            regarded as at all up-to-date she ought certainly to make a move in the
                            direction here indicated .</p>

                        <p>Your recent article on “Cyprus as a place of arms” has been read here
                            with much inte- rest, and residents in Cyprus not unnatu- rally hope
                            that the political changes now taking place may have the effect of
                            drawing attention to the various advantages of the Island and help
                            towards developing her un- doubted possibilities.</p>

                        <p>A new weekly paper has lately been started, called the “Semaia tis
                            Kyprou,” the proprietor of which is, I understand, Mr. Th. Theodo- tou.
                            The editorship, it is stated, will be undertaken by Mr. Catalanos, late
                            editor of the “Evagoras,” which was recently suppres- sed by the
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>A new hotel has lately been opened at Platres, the charming little
                            village, situated at the southern slope of Mt. Troodos. The manager and
                            proprietor is Mr. Theodotou of Limassol. This village is becoming very
                            popular in the summer among the higher classes of Limassol, and quite a
                            number of pretty villas have been built there during the last two or
                            three years.</p>

                        <p>HONOR FOR LOCAL SHOTS.</p>
                        <p>We note with satisfaction that at the great annual rifle meeting of the
                            National Rifle Association just concluded at Bisley, two of our local
                            shots, Messrs. Craig and Schilizzi, representing the Cairo B.R. Club and
                            the Alexandria B.R. Club respectively, had the honor of being presented
                            to King Edward on the occasion of his Majesty's visit to present the
                            prizes.</p>
                        <p>The shooting this year at the Bisley meeting, which annually attracts
                            from almost all parts of the world, has been of a remarkably high order,
                            and speaks volumes for the infan- try weapon of the British service,
                            which has again proved itself to be equally as good, if not slightly
                            superior to any other military rifle in existence.</p>
                        <p>We congratulate Mr. Craig, whose name appears in at least six of the
                            prize lists, on his success; and we would express the hope that our
                            local rifle clubs may be more numerously represented in the future at

                        <p>BY AN EMPLOYER OF LABOUR.</p>
                        <p>It is a hopeful sign that a spirit of in- trospection is just now abroad
                            among us. We are hearing a good deal, amongst other things, about the
                            "degeneration of the national cha- racter,” and undoubtedly it is a
                            subject de- serving of most earnest self-examination. It is my purpose
                            to allude here to one unmistak- able feature of this degeneracy, which I
                            have some opportunity of observing closely, and which no one can deny is
                            acting as a potent drag upon the moral and material well being of the
                            masses of our people, both young and old.</p>
                        <p>Engrafted upon an alarming amount of poverty and want, so largely
                            deducible from an obsolete fiscal policy, a spirit of reckless
                            thriftlessness is apparent, which shows itself in no more pronounced
                            form than in the reckless gambling which seems to be the end- all and
                            be-all of the bulk of our poorer classes at the present time. In fact,
                            the extent to which gambling on horse-racing has infected the national
                            life of the masses will hardly be credited by those whose tastes or
                            general condemnation of this particular vics has removed them from any
                            intimacy with its statistics.</p>
                        <p>It is not among those who can better afford this species of excitement
                            that the greatest harm is being worked, but among those poverty-stricken
                            thousands whose daily bread depends upon the sweat of their brows, and
                            who barely exist in a state of perennial want, in our great centres of
                            population. Is it pos- sible to imagine any more miserable spectacle
                            than that of wretched men, who cannot afford to keep their unhappy
                            families from semi- starvation, but who nevertheless, by hook or by
                            crook, scrape enough together to back a horse with the tempter at the
                            street-corner, in the demoralising hope, which no failure will cause
                            them to abandon, that some day luck will come their way? It is a hope
                            which tends to depress all genuine effort in the workless loafer and in
                            the small wage-earner alike.</p>
                        <p>Go any day into such a place as one of our great meat markets. There, if
                            you know what to look for, you will find the gutter bookie in shoals,
                            and doing his business under the very noses of the police. The
                            regrettable thing is that so few, comparatively, are ever interfered
                            with, and, in consequence, some very unfor- tunate inferences are drawn.
                            But until penal- ties are very largely increased the evil will
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>Worst of all, however, is the fact that the rising generation are quite
                            as much, if not even more deeply, vitiated than their fathers by the
                            fever of chance. There are bookmakers who devote themselves nowadays to
                            betting with boys. They will take coppers, even down to single pennies,
                            and so vast are the numbers of their young clients that they find it
                            pays them excellently. To indemnify themselves for their offer of
                            facilities in such small sums, they compel these boy gamblers to bet on
                            the composite system, that is to say, they cannot win by backing a
                            single horse in coppers, but must spot a placed horse in three races. It
                            is, of course, a much harder task, and winners are correspondingly
                            reduced in numbers, but the bait held out is a bigger prize for the
                            successful backer.</p>
                        <p>These copper bookies swarm all round the warehouses and big printers’
                            estalblishment, in the neighbourhood of which every day purblind
                            youngsters may be seen running up to them with their slips of paper and
                            a few coppers. These boys are of all ages, from twelve upwards, earning
                            from 5s. to 10s. a week. Numbers of them live in the East End, and tramp
                            every day about three miles to their work in the City, and back again.
                            Many of them have to pay over their earnings to their parents, with the
                            exception of a shilling or eighteen-pence a week, and deliberately walk
                            backwards and forwards between work and home so that they may thus save
                            a few pence to back a horse with their bookie. And for the same purpose
                            I have known them frequently to go without food in the middle of the
                            day.</p>
                        <p>The consequence of all this in that they become careless and inattentive
                            at work, until retribution overtakes them,and they lose their
                            employment. Many employers, recognising the demoralising influence of
                            some of thee halfpenny papers, with their racing tips and betting
                            prices, have prohibited their introduction into their premises. But the
                            boys somehow or other contrive to smuggle them in, and while they spend
                            all their morning thinking- in place of attention to work—of what they
                            shall back at lunch-time, during the afternoon their minds are employed
                            in wondering whether their hor- ses will win, for the wily bookie of the
                            gutter does not allow his copper clients to back their fancies both
                            ways. At last, of course, as these wretched boys get thoroughly
                            hypnotised, they not infrequently end in robbing their employ- ers or
                            parents, and are tempted to adopt any means to supply themselves with
                            money. But there is another means to hand by which this downward descent
                            is facilitated.</p>
                        <p>Just as there is the gutter bookmaker, so there is his complement, the
                            gutter usurer. This latter individual will lend any sum, down to
                            sixpence, which he deems within the paying capacity of his clients, with
                            whose circums- tances he is invariably well acquainted.</p>
                        <p> There is a man, whom I have frequently watched, in a certain London
                            district, who is doing an immense business as a moneylender of small
                            sums. His usual loans are sixpence or </p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>a shilling. On the former he charges an interest of a halfpenny, on the
                            latter a penny. It is generally towards the end of the week that his
                            clients come to him, and his loans must always be paid on the following
                            payday at the week’s end. He therefore makes an exceptionally quick
                            turnover.</p>
                        <p>He has got about 6,000 to 7,000 names on his books, of which number the
                            greater part are pretty regular customers requiring his accommodation
                            each week, and thus, at the rate of 1s. 8d. in tee pound, he has become
                            a wealthy man. His haunts are the doorways of certain public-houses, and
                            the neighbourhood of warehouses and works at times when his knowledge of
                            his customers’ hours of egress and probable necessities tells him that
                            busi- ness is to be done. In order to get through the press of work that
                            besets him, he is now always accompanied by an assistant, and when much
                            racing is toward he is exceptionally busy.</p>
                        <p>It is a queer business, and a feature of the strange invisible life of
                            our masses. If of less harmful character than that of the bookie; it
                            undoubtedly fosters and is fostered by the same demoralisation upon
                            which the latter battens. To the usurer resorts the boy who has wasted
                            his little all in vain attempts upon the gutter bookmaker, but who
                            cannot rest without the wherewithal to continue in the same course.
                            Probably Sixpence is too much for him to borrow, so he combines with two
                            equally broken companions, on the scale of twopence apiece.</p>
                        <p>The only security the usurer requires is the borrower’s place of business
                            ; his home is nothing. If he fails to pay up, the usurer pays a visit to
                            the borrower’s foreman, who is, not improbably, also a client of the
                            former, and the wretched debtor, youth or man, also finds himself in the
                            streets and out of work. Facilis descensus, for even the gutter has its
                            grades of solvency.</p>
                        <p>As may be imagined, the power which such a man gradually absorbs in a
                            district is as wonderful as his gains, and his influence upon the social
                            life of his sphere of action often manifests itself in many singular
                            forms. Not the least curious is the use to which he is sometimes put by
                            the unhappy women whose partners in life he assists to his fellow-
                            knight of the gutter. Finding themselves often left without the bare
                            necessities of existence for themselves and their children, they visit
                            the usurer and procure small sums, which are debited to their husbands,
                            and thus, in- directly, they succeed in obtaining from their gambling
                            helpmates something to rub along with which they would otherwise be left
                            without.</p>
                        <p>In this respect the gutter usurer may seem to be something of a
                            benefactor, but he is undoubtedly the means also of increasing the
                            misery and acerbity of these wretched homes, where the husband's
                            liability is too often avenged by blows and foul abuse.</p>
                        <p>Thus the eternal misery of our humblest masses is piled up year by year,
                            under its high priests, the gutter bookie and usurer. The ill-gotten
                            money which is occasionally won from the former rarely finds its way to
                            any other bourne than the pot-house bar. The winner for a brief period
                            becomes a gutter hero among his mates, and ruffles it as a ’ente fellow.
                            jTo win, if possible, Beems more demoralising than to lose; for the
                            working-man, who thus suddenly comes into a bit, receives along with it
                            no notion of thrift. As I have too often had occasion to observe, he at
                            once loses his head. He in- continently goes off work and loafs about
                            from pothouse to pothonse until his gains are spent. Then, having
                            sacrificed his regular wages, he once more turns up to work, and if, as
                            is possibly the case, he finds himself cast out, he joins the great army
                            of the un- employed, and sinks one stage lower in the social scale.</p>
                        <p>Such are certain of the influences which are working for the
                            disintegration of the lower social levels of our national life, and it
                            is very certain that if they cannot be shocked we must resign ourselves
                            to an inevi- table, if gradual, process of national deca- dence.</p>
