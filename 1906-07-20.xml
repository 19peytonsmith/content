                    <p>A DANGEROUS SCHEME.</p>
                    <p>It is sufficient to say of Mr. Haldane's new Army scheme that it more than
                        realizes the worst rebodings to which expression has been given, says the
                        “Globe.” Two battalions of the Gnards and eight battalions of the L'oe
                        are-'o he disbanded. The existing number of 6eld batteries is apparently to
                        be retained, bat their home establishment is to be reduced to a four-gnu
                        basis, except eighteen that are to be put, for some mysterious reason, on a
                        two- gun basis. The net result is a redaction of 3.800 mood in the Riling
                        Artillery, doom pained by an extraordinary arrangement under which certain
                        Militia regiments are to be converted from garrison to Geld artillery, with
                        a view* of supplying the ammnnitim columns to the brigade divisions, and of
                        firm in a Reserve of,gnnnera and drivera. At the time the release of a
                        certain number of ninth of the Regular Garrison Artillery from the dettes of
                        coast defense will allow of their absorption in the Field. The whole of the
                        Militia—Infantry, Artillery, had Beginners -is to be rendered liable to be
                        sent On foreign service, which entails, we • appose, the Goal disappearance
                        of the Militia Ballot, The Volunteers are to be er outraged by the receipt
                        of the abandoned Geld gun*, which Mr. Haldane thinks might be useful in the
                        case of a raid by a Eu rope un Power, and the whole Volunteer force is to be
                        brought into connection with some local authority, -of which the country is
                        to be the unit The details ot this last innovation are still in the dark,
                        and Mr. Haldane Was unable to enlighten the House as to the footings,
                        powers, and constitution of those bodies. Although a total rendition of
                        20,000 in the Regular AYfny is premised, Mr. Haldane, with the assent
                        outlie) Army Connoil, undertakes to have ready for war an expeditionary
                        force of 160.t)0 \ of wh .m 60,000 msn. will be with the oolongs at home,
                        70.000 will be Reservists, and the remaining 80,010 mo bilised Militia. The
                        army corps organization is abolished in favor of six big division! of,
                        infantry, containing three brigade! each, after the Indian pattern, four
                        cavalry brigades, and a full complement of artillery, the whole to form a
                        force larger by nearly a third than has hitherto been contemplated for
                        purpose outside the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>0f the disappearance of the term Army Corps we bag no partial complaint to
                        make: it is of German origin; it never Gutted in with oar pa^ system, sod
                        was float to the wind* in time ot war. 'And if a reduction was to be made in
                        the ranks of the Regular Army, it was obvious that the infantry most bus the
                        «offeror* : #vend so, we regret that Mr. Haldane did not are his way to
                        ratio tip cadres of the disappearing battalions rather than resort to the
                        drastic prosoma of disbandment And we think the redaction of the Guards a
                        moat grave error, doe apparently to tome absurd piece of sentiment Bat it'
                        is against interference with the Artillery that we ieel bound to otter the
                        strongest protest of which the language is capable. Mr. Hildaoe gave the
                        film«y pretext that andante pre-sent system only half the existing batteries
                        could be mobilized for want of man and of ammunition columns. Aa Mr. Balfout
                        pointed out in an admirable piece of criticism, a large proportion of these
                        batteries are ot new creation, and time has not yet permitted of the growth
                        of a sufficient Reserve. But this is accumulating year by year, and while
                        nearly 4,000 artillerymen are to be dismissed, Mr. Haldane alters the terms
                        of servi6* for new reaerate, substituting six yean with the toolbars and fix
                        with the Reserve for the present period of three and nine The combination of
                        those two changea most bring about a rapid and automation fall in the number
                        of men annually joining the Reserve The molt its large diminution in the
                        amount of trained artillery experts available for service at home and
                        abroad, in men, moreover, who on neither be improvised or replaced. The
                        makeshift of potting in Militia and Garrison Artillery to assist the Geld
                        batteries is an expedient which we regard with the gravest suspension. Any
                        reference to modem campaign* will show that the ammunition columns require
                        skill and experience discreetly second to what is demanded in the batteries
                        themselves; and the mingling of men trained under diffare’.t conditions and
                        with totally different experiences is bound to introduce a fatal confusion.
                        Mr. Haldane has been guided apparently by the standard of success attained
                        in on# or two picked Militia regiments. WA are afraid he has tens the victim
                        of a generalization based on exceptions. The red notion of the Artillery in
                        South Africa in the face of a native rising, aid the denudation of oar moat
                        important foreign garrisons, IA an act of sheer madness.</p>
                    <p>Nor does the ’Globe” feel any real oonGdenoe hat Mr.Haldane has secured the
                        150,000 men for his expeditionary force: his Genres are aim- (vulgarly
                        unconvincing. As we have eo long, been the victim of paper anniee, we may be
                        exoneèd if we hesitate to believe that the present secretary for War has
                        solved the problem that baa be filed all his predecessors. Wa are still met
                        by the old question, when is the British sol tier to come from? The gnat
                        fact remains» that at a moment when the armies outbid- world are striving
                        feverishly to 'ïàoraase their numbers and efficiency, and when the future is
                        black with this prao tical oratory of a straggle for oar national existence,
                        Mr. Haldane proposes to redo the effective strength of the Iritish Army by
                        20,000 men. The net saving, •o far as we can gather, is to be about a
                        million a year, a windfall which is certain to be appropriated by some crazy
                        fad of modern de moor tie Glance. And was have no guarantee that what is
                        taken eff the shoulders of the not be replaced on those of the ratepayer by
                        the County Associations. These bodies are nebulous for the present, send the
                        utmost we on hype about them is that they will do of harm to the auxiliary
                        forces the probability is that they will be in some shape or other an
                        emanation of tabs County Cannoli. It is ’-perfectly ’notorious that many ot
                        those bodies, all the Welsh tance, that of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and
                        the London County Council itself, are opposed root and branch to what they
                        oil militarism. To a substantial section of the Radical party the British
                        uniform is hateful, the British officer a gilded popinjay. To place the
                        destinies of the metropolitan volunteer’s node the control of the parochial
                        politicians IA ffyiDg Garden» I* a piece of mere lonely ; but if this IA not

                        disappointing, disheartening, and dangerous programmed, there IA none that
                        will be regarded with moresnspioion than this tampering with the Auxiliary

                        <p>About 6 o’clock yesterday evening, a young European woman was seen to
                            rash towards the quay wall in the eastern harbor, with the evident
                            intention of throwing herself iotd the water. A coastguardsman who

                            entertainment, which m a combination of the oine-:marte graph and
                            phonograph worked simultaneously, is by no means new to ns, bat judging|
                            from whit we saw of the repertoire, a very enjoyable entertainment will
                            he provided for the public. la oar opinion-, there is still considerable
                            scope for improvements in the working of the cinema phono, bat the
                            performance aa given at -the- -Z'ziuia is without doubt np to date, and
                            is as effective and perfect as is possible with the, apparatus of the
                            present day. Selections from varions joperas and comio songs were very
                            effectively reproduced. The cinematograph piotnres were - far above the
                            average and were reproduced with sharpness and an entire science of
                            flickering, which was doubt- less a revelation -to many. » Notable among
                            these may be mentioned the marriage of the King of Spain and the
                            coronation of the King and Queen of Norway. Another most accept- able
                            pioture was that of a ship in a stormy sea. This was accompanied by a
                            very realistic imitation of the sound of the waves and plunging of the
                            vessel. The large audience appeared extremely- pleased with the fare
                            provided, and many of the pictures were heartily applauded. We can
                            thoroughly recommend the entertainment as being a most excellent

                        <p>The death of Colonel W &amp; Sparked C.M.G., retired list, Welsh
                            Regiment, at the early age of forty-four, is very sad, says the “Army
                            and' play Gazette.” It was not so long ago that 1 everybody was saying
                            bow lucky he-was rio get ' promotion so early. Yet hie very good luck
                            proved in the end to his disadvantage,1 for he became a colonel in the
                            Army so early in life ( that there was -difficulty in providing for him. </p>
                        <p>In the province of Bahr el-Ghaaal his - name 1 will long be remembered -m
                            connection -with 1 the work for the reclaiming of that region ' and
                            bringing it back to oivih'sation. He 1 displayed great powers of
                            organization and administration and richly earned the C.M.G. which was
                            -conferred-upon him in acknowledgment of his services. When he * came
                            home and settled down after his retire- 1 ment he seemed to be in robust
                            health. The week before his death be was taken ill whilst c playing
                            polo. Nothing maoh was thought of the matter at the time, bat on looming
                            under medical advice bad symptoms developed, and it was soon ionnd that
                            he was seriously ill. Notwithstanding every care and attention he grew
                            worse, and on the 5th inst. he succumbed 1 to his malady. A
                            correspondent writes of him: - ,£ </p>
                        <p>“I knew poor Sparkes intimately, and knew t well what an earnest, good
                            soldier he was. If I he. had stay(ji on in the Service he could not I
                            have failed to make an even greater mark than he did, for he had all the
                            qualities which go to euanre success ; but there is no don’t that his
                            constitution became undermined whilst he j was toiling for the public
                            good. His early death deprives his friends of the companion- ship of one
                            who was popular wherever be went and capable of almost anything in the
                            shape of hard work and responsibility.” </p>

                    <p>PASSENGER SERIOUSLY INJURED. </p>
                    <p>A railway accident took place yesterday .afternoon ora' Eonbbeh Palace, with
                        the result that three persona were more or less severely . injured and a
                        certain amount of damage done t to rolling stock, etc. </p>
                    <p>The express which leaves Pont Limonn at ! 1.16 p.m. was entering Koubbeh
                        station when, through some defect in the points where Ы.Н. | the Khedive's
                        special line branches off from the ordinary line, the engine ran - on to the
                        Khédivial line, while aU bot the first of the carriages followed the main
                        line. </p>
                    <p>The leading carriage was dragged along between the rails,. While the two
                        fractions of the train which it linked, followed their respective line for
                        some 50 yards. At this point the first- carriage, which was being dragged
                        along at right angles to both sets of rails, crashed into the end of the
                        passenger L .platform.. As the engine had shat-off steam, the shook not only
                        stopped it bat sent it back; - -it ran backwards ter a short «distance bod
                        then leaving the rails toppled over on its left side. Had it fallen to the
                        right it .most have in- jured the remaining " carriages, which had also
                        backed down the line towards the points in consequence of the collision of
                        the leading oar with the end of the? platform. </p>
                    <p>The engine-driver and stoker were both injured by \the fall of the engine and
                        were sent to hospital suffering from severe bruises and general shock. One
                        passenger only was injured, but his injuries are very severe. Besides
                        serious contusions, a compound fracture of the thigh was diagnosed by the
                        doctors called up to give first aid. </p>
                    <p>It was feared last night that the victim of the accident who is believed to
                        be a son of Yawer Bey—would have to lose the injured limb, the leg having
                        been badly twisted at the moment of or immediately after the fracture. </p>
                    <p>The break down train composed of five carriages and a crane - arrived shortly
                        before 3 p.m. in charge of Mr. Peaoock and within half- an-hour the line bad
                        been cleared. Unfortunately the results of the accident persisted in a
                        general confusion which lasted till nightfall. Trains were decayed. One is
                        said to have taken half an-hourto get from Pont L;monn to Demerdache and
                        another to have arrived at Pont Limonn nearly an hour late. </p>
                    <p>Looomotive No. 563, which was injured will require extensive repairs. The
                        damage done to the carriage which collided with the end of the platform at
                        Koubbeh. Palace station is lees considerable than might have been expected.
                        The repairs to the permanent way were completed by 6 p.m. </p>
                    <p>An enquiry is being bald into the causes of the accident. </p>

                    <p>“A1 Moayad” says :—“Some papers assert that the expenses of the Special Court
                        and the pay of the employs who were engaged in the Deniahwai case amounted
                        to LB. 12,000, which amount has been approved by the Ministry of Finance.
                        Bat, as ferae we can judge, there must be a great exaggeration in the amount
                        given. If we take into account all these expenses, according to the
                        circumstances of the case, and include the fares and expenses of the
                        Advisers and the amount paid to counsel for prosecution, the total will
                        scarcely be more than L Б. 2,000. Of the other hand, we can never believe
                        the rumor that the cost of cables to Loudon and the money paid to some of
                        the London papers for producing a sensation have all been put down to the
                        account of the Egyptian Treasury." </p>
                    <p>With regard to this insinuation made by the editor of “A1 Moayad,” we should
                        like to remind Sheikh Aly Youssef that England is not Turkey, and that our
                        Press is not subsidised by the Government. If Sheikh Aly Yoursef has
                        any-proof that any British papers or their correspondents have been
                        subsidized by the British authorities here to ipubUsb . sensational versions
                        of the Deniehwai affair, let him give names and proofs. In the meantime we
                        may inform “At Moayad” that the credit opened by the Ministry of Finance
                        does not exceed L.E. 1,200). </p>

                        all feel at the unavoidable absence to day through illness of our esteemed
                        colleague, Lord Hillingdon, and we hope he will soon be with ns again, quite
                        restored to' health. In submitting to you their forty-third annual report
                        and accounts, showing the operations of the bank for the year 1905, the
                        directors have every confidence that they will be regarded as quite
                        satisfactory by the shareholders. From the agricultural point of view the
                        year 1905 has been favorable ; certain lines of railway have seen their
                        receipts augmented, and the total of the kilometrical guarantees paid by the

                    <p>The sales of the Régie have grown in notable proportions, and the receipts of
                        the Ottoman Publie Debt have likewise shown an increase, from which the
                        Government is the first to profit. I am pleased to be able to state that our
                        relations with the Imperial Government continue satisfactory. The
                        arrangement for the service of the Maoedonian Treasury commenced in March,
                        1905—centralizes in the hands of the bank the receipts and expenses of the
                        three Vilayets. We are glad to say that this method works well. Our activity
                        in the provinces has had during the year 1905 a very considerable
                        enlargement, arising not only from the creation of several new agencies and
                        offices, but also from the marked develop * men of the operations of the
                        previously existing agencies, which has given us much encouragement. </p>
                    <p>We have since the commencement of the present year created new agencies at
                        Kutahia, Xanthi, Tripoli in Barbary, Erzeroum, Caiffa, Aintab, and
                        Kerassund, of which several are already opened. Notwithstanding the initial
                        cost of establishing and administering new agencies, we are of opinion that
                        we ought still to pursue the policy of assisting the Government in
                        developing the resources of the Empire. It has to be borne in mind, however,
                        that the extension of our sphere of action, alluring as the prospect mar be.
                        entails considerable responsibilities and necessitates much pre occupation ;
                        the special requirements of each district and the training and selection of
                        a suitable staff are matters demanding the exercise of judgment and caution,
                        to say nothing of the time which must elapse before a new branch can become
                        remunerative. The deposits of the public continue to show a considerable
                        increase, notwithstanding the active competition of new banke which are
                        allowing higher rates of interest than ours, and we consider that this
                        redounds much to the credit of the bank. I take this opportunity, on behalf
                        of the committee, to thank the managers at the head offices at home and
                        abroad, as well as of the various branches, for their continued close
                        attention to their duties. They have been and are ably sapported by a loyal
                        and trusted staff. In these days of keen com- petition the calls upon the
                        staff of a large institution most be more- frequent than formerly. I am
                        certain that, with our staff constituted as it is, we shall not make those
                        calls in vain, and we shall be always ready to recognize any initiative on
                        their part which in- creases the earning power of the bank. During the
                        present year we have elected as a member of the general committee the Hon.
                        Herbert Lawrence (brother of the Hon. Henry Lawrence, who for many years
                        until his death was &amp; member of the board). Mr. Her- bert Lawrence’s
                        election is submitted for confirmation by you to day. I have every
                        confidence th t he will prove of great value to the board. I now, gentlemen,
                        beg to move : “Tlfcat tha report and accounts now read be received and
                        adopted ; that the dividend for the year ending December 31st, 190S, is
                        fixed at 16s. per share, and that this dividend be paid in Constantinople,
                        London and Paris on July 3rd, 1906.” (Applause.) </p>
                    <p>Mone. George Heine seconded the résolution, which was carried unanimously. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman next proposed that the Baron Hottiuguer and Mone. Pyrame Naville
                        be re elected members of the general committee. Barou Hottingue', he said,
                        was a very distinguished Frenchman. He had been connected with this bank
                        since its commencement, and had been its president in Paris since the year
                        1902. </p>
                    <p>Sir W. Lawrence Young seconded the motion, and it was unanimously agreed to. </p>
                    <p>On the motion of the Chairman, seconded by the Hon. G. J. Gosohen, the Hon.
                        Herbert A. Lawrence was unanimously elected a member of the general
                        committee. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman : The next resolution is of a special character, and before
                        putting it I have to state that I have been informed by the в irutioeers,
                        who have been properly appointed, that the meeting is constituted in
                        accordance with the statutes for this special purpose. The resolution is -,
                        “That the prolongation of the existence of the company until the year 1925,
                        or such further date as may be decided upon by the committee, be and is
                        hereby authorized.” That is the resolution that I beg to move. </p>
                    <p>This was seconded by Mous. Raoul Mallet, and carried unanimously. </p>
                    <p>Mr. A. Hood proposed a vote of thanks to the chairman, the general committ:o
                        and the staff. He referred to this wo k which was required to produce nearly
                        half a inillim sterling of profit, which he was sure 'every member of the
                        staff had done his share in producing. He thought, therefore, they ought to
                        remember not only the staff in Constantinople, Paris and Load in, but also
                        those in charge of the various branches. (Hear, hear.) </p>
                    <p>Mr. A. J. Allen seconded the motion, which was cordially adopted. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman acknowledged the compliment, and stated that the vote of thanks
                        which had been so unanimously passed would be conveyed to all the members of
                        the staff. </p>

                    <p>ACTION DISMISSED. </p>
                    <p>The action by Mr. Edwin William Streeter against the Egyptian Gold and Gem
                        Syndicate, Ltd., was concluded last Wednesday in the Chancery Division
                        before Mr. Justice Neville. Plaintiff claimed a declaration that the
                        company’s rights under an agreement had lapsed and that the company had no
                        right oi title to a concession and prospecting ‘license. </p>
                    <p>His Lordship, in giving judgment, said that, according to the agreement
                        (dated 19th March, 1903), the syndicate became entitled to the option of
                        acquiring the plaintiff’s concession from the Egyptian Government. Up to the
                        35th September, 1904, was the period fixed for completion, but before its
                        -expiration plaintiff and the company entered into ten agreement with the
                        Nile Development Syndicate, Ltd., and the time for the completion by the
                        latter was extended till September, 1905, to which extension plaintiff and
                        the defendant company were parties. The Nile Development Syndicate exercised
                        its option, but when it came to the end of the extended time the syndicate
                        was unable to complete its Contract, the result being that the plaintiff and
                        defendant company reverted to their original agreement. It appeareAto the
                        Lordship that according to the agreement of 7th December, 1904, plaintiff
                        joined with the defendant company in the proposal to sell the concession,
                        or. in other words, giving .the option to sell to the Nile Development
                        Syndicate. The agreement of 16th February, 1905, was entered into with a
                        dear recognition of the existence of the principal agreement His Lordship
                        could not make the declaration asked for in the statement of claim, and so
                        far as that was concerned the plaintiff’s case failed. In reference to the
                        claim for moneys, he advised counsel on both sides to come to an arrangement
                        as to the amount for which judgment ahold be given, and in view of that he
                        would adjourn that question. SC far as the action to enforce his security
                        was concerned plaintiff would get his costs, but otherwise the action would
                        be dismissed with costs. </p>

                    <p>IL DIAVOLO IN CORPO.
                    </p>
                    <p>The above piece was given on Wednesday
                        night before a well filled house and proved an
                        excellent evening’s entertainment, j edging from
                        the frequent applause metedoutto the artistes.
                        Marenoo's tuneful operetta was well rendered
                        both by singers and orchestra and the staging
                        was, as usual, much above the average for
                        Cairo1. The second act is particularly worthy
                        of mention in this respect, and much credit is
                        due to those responsible for it. Both Signore
                        Baldi and Calligaris performed up to their
                        reputation, the latter delivering two or three
                        notchy songs in very good style. The same may
                        be said of Signori Piraocini and Urbano, who
                        were again the life and soul of the pieoe. They
                        were well seconded by Sig. Saochi, as the Duke,
                        who acted and sang admirably, especially in
                        the scene in the hot with Beita, though his
                        efforts were not folly appreciated by the
                        audience. The chorus was fair and the two
                        dances given in the second act quite delighted
                        the audience, who called for an encore.
                    </p>
                    <p>We would suggest that the management
                        should make an effort to finish; somewhat
                        earlier, for several people seem to find it too
                        much to remain at the theatre till 12.45, and
                        we quite agree with them. Perhaps this would
                        be remedied by starting a little earlier and curtailing the entr’actes.
