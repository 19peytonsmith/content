                            <p> What is to be Lord Cromer’s reward ? On every side the desire is
                                expressed, says the Liberal organ, "The Tribune," that the services
                                of the great Pro-consul shall be recognized by the conferment of
                                some signal honour to mark the nation's gratitude upon the
                                completion of the memorable epoch in the history of the Empire.</p>
                            <p> What form the reward shall take is already, the subjet of keep
                                discussion, but such a wealth of honours has been heaped upon Lord
                                Cromer during his diplomatic career that the <cb n="6"/> choice of
                                elevation has become somewhat circumscribed He is a member of tho
                                Privy Council. He has received the Grand Cross Of the Oders of the
                                Bath and the St. Michael and St. George. He is a Knight Commander of
                                the Star of Indian, a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire,
                                and one of the fifteen British members of the Order of Merit.
                                Finally, during his administration he has been successively created
                                baron (1892), viscount (1898). and earl (1901).</p>
                            <p>Among the many suggestions which are being thrown out, the moat
                                general appear to be that Lord Cromer shall be given a further step
                                in the peerage or receive a money grant. As far as can be
                                ascertained there is no precedent whatever for the grant of a sum ol
                                money to a retiring diplomat. It has often been done in the case of
                                a military commander fresh from a successful campaign, and the cases
                                of Lord Kitchener and Lord Roberts are still fresh in the public
                                mind.</p>
                            <p>But the great civilian is not similarly favoured, and the case of
                                Lord Dufferin is decisive as to the practice on such occasions. Lord
                                Dufferin had rendered unexampled services to this country during his
                                occupancy of the offices of Viceroy of India, Governor-General of
                                Canada, and Ambassador at St Petersburg, Constantinople, Rome, and
                                Paris, but though notoriously a poor man, he received no financial
                                recognition beyond the customary pension on his retirement from the
                                Diplomatic Service in 1896 Not only slid he not receive a giant on
                                leaving the Paris Embassy, but he was not specially honoured in any
                                way.</p>
                            <p>Precedent also is against Lord Cromer in the circumstances receiving
                                a marquisate. The Earl of Hopetoun was certainly created Marquess of
                                Linlithgow on resigning tha Governor-Generalship of Australia in
                                1902, but this was merely an enhanced dignity for an old peerage.
                                The same applies to the marquisate conferred upon Lord Ripor upon
                                the settlement of the Alabama claims in 1871, and in a less degree
                                to the title bestowed upon Lord Dufferiu in 1888 at the close of his
                                Viceroyalty. In neither case was the marquisate conferred at the
                                close of a career, and neither recipient began public life as a
                                commoner, as Lord Cromer did. It is further pointed out that even a
                                Prime Minister of this country sitting in the Commons has no claim
                                upon a higher title than that of EarL Walpole, the elder Pitt, and
                                Disraeli received earldoms, and it is an open secret that Mr.
                                Gladstone refused one.</p>
                            <p>There is, however, an honour far transcending that of a step in the
                                peerage which may fittingly and with sufficient precedent be
                                conferred upon Lord Cromer In well-informed quarters the belief is
                                entertained that be will be offered the Garter. By tradition the
                                Garter is the gift of the King, and its conferment upon Lord Cromer
                                would have an international significance, seeing that it is the
                                order associated with sovereignty. The precedent is a very striking
                                one— that of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, “the Great Elchi,” who
                                received the Garter in 1869 in recognition of his services as
                                Ambassador at Constantinople. Stratford Canning’s Garter was
                                especially noteworthy because it was one of the extremely rare
                                instances of that favour being bestowed upon a peer below the rank
                                of an Earl.</p>
                            <p>At the present moment the Order of the Garter has its full complement
                                of twenty-four knights, the most recent vacancy having been filled
                                by Earl Carrington, Lord Stratford had to wait for a vacancy before
                                receiving the Garter, but there is a precedent for temporarily
                                raising the number of knights in exceptional circumstances. When
                                Disraeli and Lord Salisbury returned from Berlin in 1878, after
                                negotiating the famous treaty, both statesmen were given the Garter,
                                although there was only one vacancy.</p>
                            <p>If Lord Cromer becomes a Knight of the Garter on his return from
                                Egypt a deserved honour will have been conferred without creating
                                the possibility of a dangerous precedent.</p>

                        <p>Under date of yesterday our Suez Correspondent writes:—Yesterday owing to
                            the strong northerly wind and sand storm, all steamers had to be moored
                            in the Canal till the afternoon when a large number of steamers came out
                            of the Canal. The same thing was done in the Suez roads, and several
                            steamers were waiting to enter. Towards the evening a procession of no
                            less than 15 steamers entered the Canal.</p>

                        <p>The Asia Minor S.S. Co. of Alexandria are commencing their regular summer
                            sailings to Cyprus porta about June 1st. The company's passenger
                            steamers run direct from Alexandria to Limassol, thence to Famagusta and
                            Larnaca, returning to Alexandria via Port Said. The round trip occupying
                            some 67 days in a pleasant one, and we can recommend it to those who are
                            fond of a sea voyage. The climate of the Cyprus high lands is
                            particularly fine and the island, being within easy reach of Egypt, is
                            becoming yearly a more favourite summer resort.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday the fire brigade were called out three times First at 10.10
                            a.m. to an outbreak at the offices of the Tramway Co. in Boulevard de
                            Ramleh, where a large cupboard was practically destroyed; it was
                            extingnished by chemical apparatus : at 7.47 last evening to the Midan
                            where one room and staircase were damaged, and at 10.20 to an oil and
                            colour shop in the Attarin quarter, where the door had to he burst open
                            to get at the fire, which was quickly extinguished by means of one
                            hydrant. This brings the total number of fires up to 70 this year.</p>

                        <p>Donkey Polo in Sennar</p>
                        <p>There is a delightful touch of humour contained in that portion of Lord
                            Cromer's Report which deals with the Sudan. In summarising Major
                            Wilson’s report on the province of Sennar, Lord Cromer remarks that the
                            “following observation is characteristic of British administration.
                            Major Wilson writes : ‘Advantage was taken of the pressence of numerous
                            head sheikhs at the cotton show to initiate them into the game of polo
                            on donkeys. Matches were played between teams of sheikhs, who took to
                            the game in an extraordinary manner. ” The “Spectator" in commenting on
                            this passage remarks : “It seems to us that Major Wilson by his bold
                            experiment with the Sennar sheikhs may have unconsciously produced
                            world-wide results. Polo on donkeys would be an admirable new sport for
                            elderly men of action for whom real polo has become too dangerous. We
                            also recommend donkey polo to enterprising hostesses in country houses
                            anxious to find amusement for their guests. Most mining villages, as
                            well as most seaside resorts, ought easily to be able to produce eight
                            donkeys to make a beginning, while country houses in Kent and Essex
                            would have the whole of the coster donkeys of the East End to draw upon.
                            We wonder whether the donkeys soon get keen on the game like ponies, and
                            learn to follow the ball. Also, do their ears get in the way ?”</p>

                        <p>SERIOUS DISTURBANCES.</p>
                        <p>MILITARY DEMONSTRATION</p>
                        <p>A serious state of affairs prevails in Cairo and there is a very uneasy
                            feeling prevalent that troubles of a grave nature may break out. So
                            seriously indeed is the situation regarded by the officials that Mr
                            Machell, Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, who had left on a
                            journey to Mariout, has had to be recalled to Cairo. The strike of the
                            cabmen, as we announced on Friday, is over and on Saturday the cabs were
                            plying as usual. But as soon as this strike had been settled the carters
                            began to rise up and a grave series of outrages took place on Saturday,
                            which has alarmed the inhabitants of the Capital, for the movement is
                            not considered to be solely provoked by economical reasons. At 11 am. a
                            large mob, consisting of many hundreds of natives, assembled suddenly at
                            the khalig near Darb el Gamamy and at once began to savagely attack the
                            trams. The mob broke the windows, maltreated the employes of the Tramway
                            company and the passengers: all traffic was stopped and the street
                            blocked. At the same time another huge mob gathered together in the
                            Gouvernoat square Mansfield Pasha harangued them in Arabic and the
                            mounted police cleared the square. Twenty employes of the Cairo Tramway
                            Company have been injured and forty-three tram cars have been damaged.
                            It is considered that these outrages have been inspired by some
                            well-known persons who want to encourage disorder for their own
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>The serious outrages in the trams have no perceptible connection with
                            either the strike ol the cabmen or the carters. There were other
                            outbursts of the mob and at Abou el Ala bridge a crowd assembled. The
                            manifests, who had a threatening attitude, were prevented from doing any
                            harm and the police made some arrests. All traffic on the tram lines at
                            Boulac, Old Cairo, and the Khalig was suspended at 6 p.m. and on the
                            other lines at between 9 and 10 p.m. Egyptian troops were stationed at
                            the poliee posts.</p>
                        <p>POPULAR ALARM.</p>
                        <p>The Cairo newspapers express the alarm felt generally at these disorders.
                            “Les Pyramides" remarks “what is particularly disquieting in this one is
                            that the outcry is not made against the employers, as is usually the
                            case in strike troubles, but against the Government and its agents. Some
                            people are asking themselves whether these demands, whose object is to
                            alarm public opinion and which, moreover, are not due to trade
                            interests, do not conceal political issues are fomented by some people
                            whose interest it is to disturb the water in order to fish the
                            better.”</p>
                        <p>The “Journal du Caire” in its issue of Saturday also expresses the
                            popular alarm at these sudden and simultaneous outbreaks ot disorder
                            after the cessation of the cab Strike. It remarks : ‘We had good reason
                            to declare in ourlast issue that there were evilly disposed persons who
                            wished to fish in troubled water. This cannot any longer admit of the
                            slightest doubt in view of the fresh outbreak of disorder this morning.
                            The cabs are plying again and yet the trams are attacked ! Why is this ?
                            What can he the motive for it! Who are the people who are directing it.
                            We hold that we have the right to put these questions and it is the duty
                            of the police to answer. This stupid but suggestive agitation has
                            continued too long. These recent events clearly show that at the present
                            time there is a large number of people in Cairo without any occupation,
                            whose pleasure it is to utilise their leisure in the refined amusement
                            of maltreating the passengers and the staff of the tramways. In such a
                            case the poliee in every country in the world sweeps them away and
                            clears the town of this disagreeable class. When are we to have a
                            clearance at Cairo ?’</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted as a coincidence of some significance that both these
                            newspapers, from which we have quoted, and which appear at the same
                            time,make use of the same expression “pecher en eau trouble.”</p>
                        <p>LATEST NEWS.</p>
                        <p>Our Cairo correspondent telephoning to-day at 1 p.m. states that there
                            has been no renewal of the disorders to-day. Last night the whole force
                            of the Cairo City Police were on duty and in readiness for any
                            emergency. The Ministry of the Interior had taken special measures to
                            ensure the safety of the Cairo Gouvernorat from attack and it was
                            guarded by soldiers. Throughout yesterday there was a vague presentiment
                            of coming troubles and a renewal of the disturbances but no incidents of
                            a serious character are reported.</p>
                        <p>The carters of Cairo, who are among the roughest elements of the
                            populace, remain quiet.</p>
                        <p>The troops of the Anny of Occupation were called out last night and
                            paraded round the Boulac quarter, where the troubles appeared to be the
                            gravest.</p>
                        <p>The demonstration has had, it is hoped, a good effect. If, however, the
                            disorders continue the most severe measures will be token to ensure
                            quiet.</p>
                        <p>Extraordinarily disquieting rumours were afloat at Alexandria this
                            morning as to the state of affairs in the Capital and it was confidently
                            announced that the troops of the Army of Occupation had had to be called
                            out. The news exerted a very bad effect in the Bourse and considerable
                            nervousness was the result.</p>

                        <p>MEETING AT ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                        <p>The special committee of the Alexandria Municipal Commission couvened a
                            general meeting at the Municipal Palace at 11 o’clock yesterday morning
                            in order to discuss the question of a memorial to Lord Cromer. The
                            attendance was very representative, with the noticeable exception that
                            outside the representatives of the Press there was not a single Moslem
                            present. The discussion was long and desultory and the meeting did not
                            break up until 1.30 p m. Some confusion has been caused owing to the
                            fact that after the special committee of the Municipality had sent a
                            letter to Lord Cromer and had received a reply from his lordship in
                            favour of a tuberculous institution, a letter was received from the
                            President of the Council of Ministers asking Alexandria to join with
                            Cairo. The Cairo committee had nominated some Alexandria to serve on a
                            general committee but had neglected to ask the Alexandria Municipality
                            to select some of its members for this purpose. Mr. Salvago strongly
                            protested in the name of the Municipality at this treatment. The
                            Municipality was the most important representative institution in Egypt
                            and was representative of Alexandria, and it was a grave want of taste
                            not to ask it officially to select some of its members to serve on the
                            committee and to ignore the fact that the Municipality had taken the
                            initiative in the matter.</p>
                        <p>It was decided that Schiess Pasha, Mr. Salvago and Pados Bey should go to
                            Cairo in order to discuss the question with the committee there and put
                            forward Alexandria’s views. It was also agreed that Alexandria should
                            take part in the manifestation at the Khedivial Oprea House and that the
                            city should be represented on that occasion by delegates of the
                            Municipality and the corporations. There was a strong feeling that the
                            memorial should be in Alexandria, but at the same time the meeting was
                            in favour of working in accord with Cairo and the rest of Egypt. It was
                            decided that a tubercolous institution was the most useful form which a
                            memorial should take and that if such an instution should come into
                            being, it was to be international and undenominational and that
                            arrangements as to the food supply should be such as not in any way to
                            impinge on Jewish or Moslem scruples in the same way as the Rudolph

                            honour of Lord Cromer has decided that the ceremony shall take place on
                            May 4th at 6 o'clock in the Opera House. A sub committee will prepare
                            and issue invitations to as many as the theatre will hold. There will be
                            two speeches in the name of the committee and Lord Cromer will reply.
                            The committee has approved in principle the opening of a general
                            subscription to be devoted to such a purpose as shall be eventually
                            determined ; it has, moreover, recommended that the Municipality of
                            Alexandria be invited with a view to the dignity of the occasion to
                            cooperate with the Cairo committee by delegating such of their members
                            as they may think best. Similar invitations will be issued to the other
                            towns of Egypt, in order to allow all who are desirous of joining in the
                            demonstration the opportunity to associate themselves with the measure
                            finally adopted by the committee.</p>

                        <p> We take from the prospectus the eminently favorable report of Messrs.
                            Russell, Kerr, and Wyatt, the well-known accountant experts:—</p>
                        <p>H. DE VIRED &amp; BOUTIGNY, LIMITED.</p>
                        <p>We have investigated the books and accounts of Messrs. H. de Vries et
                            Boutigny, Cairo for the period from 1st of May, 1905, to 22nd March,
                            1907, and we certify that the Profits of the business for that period,
                            before charging interest on Capital or Partners’ salaries amount to
                            £329,404 sterling.</p>
                        <p>Of these Profits, £195,780 sterling is derived from land transactions and
                            £133,624 sterling from share transactions and other sources.</p>
                        <p>The Profits derived from land transaction include an amount of £88,577
                            sterling, payable at dates subsequent to the close of the financial
                            period under review, and therefore, unrealized at this date.</p>

                        <p>Few banking firms could justify such exceptional results and we might add
                            that everything promises an equally satisfactory future. Let us remind
                            our readers that the subscription will only be open on Wednesday next

                            development as by the modified contract provided. The consideration for
                            the said modifications is the payment by the company to the development
                            company of the sume of twenty thousand pounds sterling.</p>
                        <p>By the latter of these contracts, which is part of the same arrangement,
                            the company agrees to indemnify the development company against all
                            claims by Mr. Ceaser Ritz under an agreement dated 20th November 1906,
                            referred to in a prospectues of the Company and also in respect of an
                            agreement made by the company with Barson Hand Pfyffer, dated the 6th
                            December, 1906, under which these gentlemen would have become entitled
                            to share in the future commission, and the benefits of such agreements
                            are transferred to the company, Mr. Ritz and Baron Hans Pfyffer
                            releasing all claim to the £20,000 above referred to.</p>
                        <p>On the motion Mr. Mosseri, seconded by Matire Carton de Wiart, it was
                            resolved unanimously that tese contratcs be approved. Neither Baron
                            Pfyffer, Mr. Matesdorf nor Mr. Bacos voted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Matesdorf then addressed the meeting on behalf of the chairman as
                            follows. :-</p>
                        <p>"As you are aware, the issue has been a great success , and the building
                            of the hotel has been commenced and is going ahead with all speed
                            compatible with good contraction Unfortunately contract prices for
                            building material and operations had gone up considerably. We shall call
                            you to an extrordinary meeting soon which will lutve several questions
                            to consider.</p>
                        <p>“It is desirable to transferthe management to Egypt instead of having it
                            in London, and the London board cannot under these circumstances
                            continue the responsibility of control. This will necessitate a number
                            of changes in the articles of association, which will to submitted for
                            your approval. Then we are going to considerably enlarge the sphere to
                            operations and do other hotel and property buisness at Cairo and
                            Alexandria, and probably elsewhere. Again, we propose to abolish
                            entirely the founders’ shares and we will submit to you an arrangement
                            which we consider equitable. All these proposals will require an
                            increase of capital. We trust, subject to other arrangements, to obtain
                            a sufficient guarantee of capital by the placing of shares at a suitable
                            price. I hope that these projects will contribute to the success of our
                            enterprise.’’</p>
                        <p>Mr. Matesdorf on behalf of the chairman then thanked the shareholders for
                            their attendance at the meeting. The proceedings were then terminated
                            with a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman.</p>
