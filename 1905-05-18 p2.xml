Mr. BALFOUR'S SPEECH.
The home papers to hand miming
contain full report! of Mr. Balfour’s greit
speech in the House of Commous this day
week. The Prime Minister's speeoh was a
double triumph—for the speaker himself, and
for principles with which the party he repre-
sents has ever been specially identifiel. It was
a personal triumph, inaamuoh as it showed Mr.
Balfou'r at his best, rising above the littleness
of the daily strife of parties—wherein, for all
his skill in debate, the Premier does not exoel
because he does not care for the gamo—and
sunning himself ia the largo liberty of a theme
of permanent patriotic interest of supremo
importance. Mr. Balfour is at home on the
heights, and thithor, last Thursday, he was
able not only to lead that party which stands
in a special sense for the care of National and
Imperial defeuoe, but to do much more. Ho
led even those who habitually affeot to regard
the integrity of our Islands and of the British
Empire as a matter for which we, like the lilies
of the field, need toil not neither spin, beoause
there is a law of nature by which 8amson, in
all his strength, was not arrayed in suoh I
armour of proof as envelops the United King-
dom and the vast collection of dependencies
which it has, almost unconsciously and wholly
unintentionally, gathered round it</p>
<p>However, Mr. Balfour carried the wholeHouse
with him, which, we repeat «u a triumph for
him an4 for the party which does like Imperial-
ism, rightly understood, njnoh—and muoh
more to that Furthermore, his speech, as the
■‘Times’’ says, marks a stago in the history of
the question of Imperial defence. Why so I
Beoause it induced the House of Commons to
•ooopt the principle which underlies the crea-
tion of the Imperial Defeuoe Committee. We
hare but to look back a very few years
to realise that the mere creation of a
permanent oonsultative body, instead of the
tampon cowritters, dealing with
questions, having no continuous existence and
keeping no continuous records, which was all
we ever had before, constitutes a veritable
revolution in our procedure. Time was, and
not very long ago, when aU the Departments
would have arisen and prophesied concerning
it that it was a most un-British institution -
as, indeed, we are not sure that it is not—aud
that we might very weU have gone on as we
did, not merely iD pre-Crimean days, but even
for thirty years after the war of 1870, and all
that followed it, should have roused us to a
sense of the realities of the age we live in.
Well, God be thanked for our good amends !
As the result of a tardy national awakening
we have got a Navy, and there is some hope
that, in the course of time, we may even get
an Army as weU. Before we do so, however, it
is desirable, not to say necessary, that we
should know for what precise object we require
the land forces for which we pay at present
£53,000,000 per annum without getting value
for one money. That object, as Mr. Balfour
tells us, must be considered from the stand-
points of home, colonial, and Indian defence.
: As to the Colonies, their fate must depend on
that of the mother country: if once England
received that “blow over the heart" against
which the late Lord Salisbury warned her, ihe
individual power of any Colony to resist an
enemy would avail no little. To avert the "blow
over the heart”—successful invasion of the
British islands—we may, Mr. Balfour holds,
depend upon the Navy: we do not need an
Army for home defense. In his opinion, which
is that of the Committee, "serious invasion
of. these islands is not an eventuality
which we need seriously consider.” Given
a sufficiently powerful Navy, that conclu-
sion may be accepted without demur, albeit
we should be considerably surprised to learn
that military entire on the Continent are
prepared henceforward to regard successful
invasion of England as outside the sphere of
praoticsl politics. Let ns here, by the way,
congratulate Mr. Balfour upon the admirable
tone of his theoretical reference to France as
the moat obvious quarter when the invasion
most, owing to geographical conditions, be
looked for. That a»nmption—happily, now,
parely theoretical—need not, of ooarse,exoluda
an intelligent appreciation of the foot that
Franoe is not the only Continental Power with
a greatNavyand with ports oonveniently situat-
ed in rather close proximity to the shore of Eng-
land. On that latter snbjeot the silence ot the
Premier is, perhaps, not lees significant than
words would have been—and oonsiderebly lees
liable to misconstruction. Wherefore we must
again congratulate. It was, however, with
the military requirements of the North-West
frontier of India that Mr. Balfour was mainly
condemed. He showed, in language of the
utmost courtesy, but of unflinchiug firmness,
that England oan permit no ’extension of
the powerful Russian railway system, which
has already reached the Afghan border, into
the territories of the Ameer. Afghanistan must
remain the "glacis,” as Ljrd Cureon has
called it, across whioh no possible enemy
can be allowed, in peaoe time, to creep np
to the walls of the Indian fortress. We cannot
be too thankful to Mr. Balfonr for having
laid down that fundamental proposition in
absolutely unmistakable terms. To do that was
all the more necessary because our inevitable
result of the present war in the Par East
must be to throw the expansive energy
of Russia baok upon the Middle East.
It is towards India, aud towards the Per-
sian Gulf, that Russian ambition will ne-
cessarily look, and it will be for us to see
to it that Russia shall not find in either of
those directions her line of least resistance
That is a theme which might be discussed at
any length ; for the preseut we have only to
thank the Prime Minister for his luminous and
comprehensive exposition of that whole pro-
blem ol the defense of the Empire which must
be the permanent object of the solicitude of a
strong and continuous military policy.</p></div>
