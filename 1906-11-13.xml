                <p>THE MAGNETIC NORTH.</p>
                <p>When Dr. Nansen visited England after his last long sojourn in the Arctic night,
                    he pointed out that he had left nearly four degrees between his “Farthest North”
                    and the Polo itself to be covered by English enterprise. The margin has been
                    twice reduced in the inter­vening years - on the first occasion by the Duke of
                    the Abruzzi’s expedition, and on the second through the indomitable persistence
                    of Com­mander Peary. That gallant American sailor has crowned his fifth
                    expedition into the unknown by reaching a latitude of 87 deg. 6 min. N., or
                    within 203 miles of the spot which eye hath not seen, but towards which human
                    wonder stretches with an indefatigable yearn­ing. Commander Perry’s success (for

                    explorer, an American vessel, and an American route,” and Englishmen will add
                    their congratulations all the more cordially with the knowledge that the captain
                    of the good ship Roosevelt chose to man her with a Newfoundland crew. The
                    journey, says the “Pall Mall Gazette,” has produced additions to the lore of
                    geography of which only a vague impression is yet con­veyed by the brief
                    telegraphic reports of its experience. Land boundaries have apparently been
                    discovered which will set the map-makers to work again, and on the recondite
                    subject of ocean currents Commander Peary will have further additions to make to
                    that important body of facts which was brought home by Dr. of Nansen. The steady
                    progress of the art of ex­ploration is shown by the successful provision against
                    contingencies through which the leader of this latest venture has been able to
                    return ’ with the whole membership of his expedition r safe and sound. Violent
                    gales interfered with certain of its plans, and one of the supporting parties
                    was rescued only when it had reached the confines of starvation. But Peary, like
                    Nansen, has avoided paying the tribute of life * either to disease or hardship,
                    and has thus done much to weaken the objections which Philis­tine philosophy is
                    too prone to urge against the prosecution of Arctic adventure.</p>
                <p>The new “record’’-holder of the Far North will have something to say, doubtless,
                    on <hi rend="bold">the possibilities of ultimately reaching </hi>the Pole as
                    they seem to be affected by his own exploit. That the boundaries of the
                    “undiscovered country” have been pushed backwards by nearly sixty miles in ten
                    years encourages further persistence in the dream of a cen­tury. On the other
                    hand the obstacles to sledge-travel for more than a certain distance from their
                    base, of which both Peary and Nansen have gained such full experience, inspire
                    obvious doubts as to the remaining two hundred miles being within the compass of
                    possibility. Speculation may turn again towards the balloon or airship plan, and
                    it is noteworthy that the tragedy of Andre’s fate has not prevented other
                    projects of a similar kind from being pressed forward. Mr. Wellman proposes to
                    make his start by the aerial route next year, and his scheme would appear to
                    involve the conjoint potentialities of brilliant success and hopeless disaster.
                    With good fortune a dash across the Pole might be conceivably possible where
                    there are no weary weeks to be consum­ed in the labours of painful and arduous
                    transport; at the same time, such a gale as Commander Peary encountered beyond
                    the 85th parallel would presumably mean the end of all things for the aeronaut
                    who fell in with its tender mercies. In any case, the pursuit of the Pole will
                    not cease to enlist the energies of the harder nations and of those peoples
                    which aspire to lead the world either in Empire or knowledge. It is a symptom of
                    degeneracy, whenever such enter­prise comes to be slighted as a mere form of
                    infatuation. Arctic exploration is in no sense a fruitless expenditure of life
                    and energy in the cause of vain glory. It holds the key to many secrets for <hi
                        rend="bold">which </hi>Science is clamorous, and its risks are only those
                    which races with the instinct of conquest are ever ready to court for their
                    ideals. The Arctic field is almost neglected just now by Englishmen, <hi
                        rend="bold">though </hi>we can happily point <hi rend="bold">to </hi>the
                    records of the Discovery and the Scotia at the earth’s other extremity in proof
                    that the spirit of Franklin, Parry, McClure and Nares is <hi rend="bold">not
                    </hi>extinguished. The great Ice Wars are not the least important test of
                    national vita­lity, anti if the races for the Poles are never to be won, the
                    country which can claim to be foremost in them still holds no empty honour.</p>

                    <p>DEATH OF LORD CONGLETON.</p>
                    <p>A telegram from London announces the death of Lord Congleton, brother of the
                        Hon. Mrs. Henry Hopkinson, wife of Miralai Hop- kinson Bey, which occurred
                        in London yester­day.</p>
                    <p>Major General Henry Parnell, Lord Congle- ' ton, was the second son of the
                        3rd Baron, and , grandson of Col. the Hon. William Bligh. He was born in
                        1839 and succeeded his father in 1896. On leaving Sandhurst he passed into
                        the Buffs and served in the Crimea and Zululand, and from 1895 to 1900 he
                        commanded the Infantry Brigade at Gibraltar; in the latter year he was
                        transferred to Malta, and he retired from the Service two years later. In
                        1885 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Dugald Dove, of Nutshill,
                        Renfrew.</p>
                    <p>Lord Congleton is succeeded by his eldest son, the Hon. Henry Bligh Fortescue
                        Parnell, who was born in September 1890.</p>
                    <p>THE PLAGUE.</p>
                    <p>During the week ending last Saturday,</p>
                    <p>’ seven cases of plague were notified throughout Egypt, viz., 2 at
                        Alexandria, 2 at Port Said, 1 at Suez, 1 in the Samallout district (Minieh),
                        1 in the Tantah district.</p>
                    <p> Five deaths took place during the week, three of which occurred outside
                        hospital. Three recoveries are recorded, all of which were European oases
                        treated at Alexandria, and eleven cases remained under treatment.</p>
                    <p>• Since January there have been in all 525 cases of plague, as compared with
                        265 and 824 during the corresponding periods of 1905 and 1904
                        respectively.</p>
                    <p> To day’s plague bulletin reports two recov- eries, one of which occured at
                        Alexandria and the other at Samallout, and one admis­sion to hospital at
                        Suez One case at Suez ended fatally yesterday.</p>
                    <p>PROVINCIAL MUNICIPALITIES.</p>
                    <p> Of late years the provincial municipalities of Egypt have increased in
                        number consider­ably. The latest town to solicit municipal self-</p>
                    <list type="simple">
                        <item>government is Emeh, and the question is now being considered by the
                            Ministry of the Interior.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p> The creation of municipalities in the small towns of the Interior can hardly
                        be considered quite satisfactory as yet In his last report, attached to that
                        of the Ministry of Public Work, Mr. Perry, as in his previous one,
                        criticises un favourably the work done by these municipalities and in
                        connection therewith Sir William Garstin remark-: “I have no doubt whatever
                        that his are just, and that the quality of this work leaves much to be
                        desired. Also, that some of the expenditure may not unfairly be styled waste
                        of morey. Nevertheless, the experiment of local self- government is worth
                        continuing. Time and patient instruction will doubtless improve
                        matters.”</p>
                    <p> THE DIANA RECOMMISSIONED i * ——</p>
                    <p> The cruiser Diana (Captain R. S. Phipps Hornby, C.M.G.) wus paid off on
                        Tuesday last week at Devonport on her return from the Mediterranean Station,
                        for which she was re-</p>

                <head>THE MODERN EGYPTIAN.</head>
                <p>HIS MANNERS AND MORALS.</p>
                <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                <p>Dear Sir,—“A1 Moayad” has published an interesting reply to my last tetter, the
                    author of which points out that generalisation is nsnally unjust. This I admit
                    again, and again point out that in any community the majority does generalise
                    and <hi rend="bold">
                        <hi rend="italic">mutt</hi>
                    </hi> generalise. It has not the time, the judgment, or, I fear, the desire to
                    do otherwise.</p>
                <p>1 am quite ready to subscribe to “Al Moayad’s” opinion that women of all
                    na­tionalities are absolutely safe from molesta­tion in the shops of the
                    principal Arab traders. Indeed, I consider the Moslem merchants of Cairo to be
                    in manners and morals far superior to the classes that are ranked above them.
                    But when ladies who understand Arabic are lucky if they can pass in front of
                    certain cates, etc., situated in the most respectable quar­ters of Cairo,
                    without hearing the most atro­cious comments, every section of the Euro­pean
                    community which cares for the honour of its women and their freedom from
                    mo­lestation will naturally form a low opinion of the whole class to which the
                    ribald imperti- neuta belong. It is, moreover, unfortunately true that those who
                    are the worst offenders in this respect are not ignorant workmen or fellaheen,
                    but men possessed of some means and education, often holders of grades—in fact,
                    corresponding to the upper middle class of European countries.</p>
                <p>My critic remarks : “We recognise the excellent character borne by Englishwomen
                    of the upper classes. Cannot their very virtues im­pose respect ?” True, in
                    theory. But in practice self-respecting men are extremely unwilling to take the
                    risk that their wives or sisters will succeed in imposing this respect on all
                    their Moslem visitors. They argue that if men belonging to ‘a superior class” of
                    Egyptian can insult respectable women in public - and these insults are
                    unhappily too frequent just now—it is best to avoid close social relations with
                    that class for the present. I grant that in many cases the generalisation is
                    unjust, but it is based upon certain well-known facts. H.H. Princess Nazli Hanem
                    is quoted by Mr. de Guerville as giving a very unfavourable opi­nion of the
                    class to which I refer.</p>
                <p>Finally, I should like to point out to my Egyptian critics that the women of the
                    country are extraordinarily free from insult on.the part of Europeans, and that
                    on the principle of reciprocity it is only reasonable that European women should
                    claim and deserve the same immunity.—I am, etc.,</p>

                <p>MAHOMEDANS IN INDIA.</p>
                <p>It is stated that it is settled in effect that the Mahomedans of India shall hold
                    an annual gathering to counterbalance in some measure the National Congress of
                    the Hindus. The Aga Khan and the Nawab of Dacca are at the head of this
                    movement, which is one of the most significant that has taken place in India for
                    many years past. A scheme for the con­ference has been prepared by the Nawab of
                    Dacca, and is to be submitted for confirmation to the principal Moslem societies
                    of India. No centre for the holding of'this Mahomedan Congress has yet been
                    selected, but the choice is thought to be between Agra and Lahore. It is hoped
                    that incidentally this conference will be the means every year of raising at
                    least a lakh of rupees for he Mussulman charities.</p>

                <p>Lieut. A.B. Wilkie, 2nd Battalion Royal Sussex Regiment, who arrived at
                    Alexandria from Crete a few days ago, will embark on the transport Sicilia at
                    Port Said on the 16th inst. en route for Peking.</p>
                <p>Captain R. S. Bostock, R.A.M.C., will also embark on the Sicilia for duty daring

                <p>MOTOR BOATS FOR EGYPT.</p>
                <p>In our issue of October 23 we mentioned the fact that Messrs. Dixon Bros, and
                    Hut­chinson, consulting engineers, of Woolston, Southampton, were sending three
                    motor boats, designed and built by the firm, to Alexandria and Caro, and fall
                    particulars of the boats were then given.</p>
                <p>These boats will remain in Alexandria for one week and permission to view them
                    can be obtained by applying at the offices of Messrs. James Carroll Wilcocks and
                    Co., 12, rue Mahmoud Pasha el Falaki, the agents of Messrs. Dixon Bros, and
                    Hutchinson for Egypt and the Sudan, to whom all necessary arrange­ments for the
                    reception of the beats have been entrusted. Messrs. Dixon Bros, and Hutchinson
                    intend to sell all three boats if possible in either Alexandria or Cairo, but
                    before selling in Alexandria they reserve the right of running the boats to
                    Cairo and back by the Mahmou- dieh Canal. There are already two sailing yachts
                    designed and built by this firm in the harbour, namely, Isis II. and Banshee
                    II., both of which have been most successful.</p>
                <p>The S.S. Adalia, with the two boats <hi rend="bold">on </hi>board is expected to
                    arrive-on Friday, the 16th inst. </p>
                <p>We must congratulate Messrs. Dixon and Hutchinson on their enterprise and wish
                    them every success in introducing what seems likely to become a most important
                    business in Egypt, the Upper Nite, and the Sudan.</p>

                <head>EGYPTIAN PATRIOTISM.</head>
                <p>LACK OF UNITY</p>
                <p>Mahmoud Taher Effendi Haki is the author of an interesting article upon the much
                    dis- cussed question of Egyptian patriotism, in which he attributes its
                    feebleness to the aloof­ness of the classes of the people.</p>
                <p>It is not open to doubt, he says, that the Egyptians love their country and
                    devoutly wish her to reach the level of the most pros­perous countries of the
                    world, but that love of country is individual and not public-spirited, owing to
                    the want of cohesion among the classes of the nation.</p>
                <p>To show a real and national feeling of patriotism the Egyptians must adapt
                    them­selves to the existing conditions by <hi rend="bold">a </hi>wise and
                    moderate policy. They most dearly recognise the obligation under which England
                    has placed them by raising the country to a height of prosperity never attained
                    by their forefathers, whose ambitions were easily satis­fied. But the
                    present-day Egyptian is discon­tented with the progress which has been made
                    possible to him.</p>
                <p>When England occupied this country after the rebellion of Arabi the political
                    change which robbed them of their independence was unwelcome. British influence
                    grew year by year and after a quarter of a century the Egyptian nation opposes
                    the occupying Power on one all-important point. The Egyptians assert their
                    capability of assuming their own Government, and, on the other hand, England
                    contends that the time is not yet ripe for them to stand alone.</p>
                <p>But neither of these contentions, continues the writer, is beneficial to the
                    people, and a moderate policy must be adopted by both sides. On our side, we
                    should not deceive ourselves with illusive dreams. England could never withdraw
                    white the country is in such a state of torpor. The British authorities, who
                    took so strong a stand when every Euro­pean country was against them, will not
                    retire now when their relations with all the Powers are so amicable.</p>
                <p>On the other hand England would have no right in patting the Egyptians under a
                    yoke of injustice, and in turning a deaf ear to their rightful deoMids. Let both
                    nations act in harmony for the country’s weal, and with the progress of
                    education the independ­ence of Egypt will be regained.</p>
                <p>CORPORATION OF WESTERN</p>
                <p> EGYPT, LIMITED.</p>
                <p>The following circular letter has been issued to the shareholders</p>
                <p>“Dear Sir (or Madam),—Important infor­mation relating to the trial crops of
                    cotton grown on the newly reclaimed lands of the Corporation has now come to
                    hand, and samples of three of the four varieties of Egypt­ian cotton cultivated
                    this season have been received from Egypt and are open to inspec­tion by
                    shareholders at the offices of the Corporation. These samples comprise : Yano-
                    vitz cotton- Grown, headquarters, Khargeh Oasis, Bore I. ; planted, March
                    14-March 16, 1906. The bolls are not selected. They are the earliest ripened.
                    This is the first cotton crop from land which was only last year re­claimed.
                    Afifi cotton—Grown, headquarters, Khargeh Oasis, Bore I. ; planted, March 14
                    March 16, 1906 ; picked, August 14, 1906. The bolls are not selected. They are
                    from those earliest ripened. This is the first cotton crop from land only last
                    year brought under cultivation. Abbassi cotton— Grown, headquarters, Khargeh
                    Oasis, Bore I. The first cotton crop from land brought under cultivation only
                    last summer. Planted, March 14-Maroh 16, 1906 ; picked, August 14, 1906. The
                    bolls are not selected They are from the earliest ripened. (N.B.—The comment is
                    that of the agricultural chemist to the Corporation.)</p>
                <p>“Ia view of the fact that cotton is now show­ing a profit of no less than £20 per
                    feddan, the following valuation made in Egypt by cotton experts is significant
                    of the return that may now be anticipated from the cultivation of cotton on a
                    large scale on the reclaimed lands : Yanovitz, P.T. 425-460 per kantar ; Afifi,
                    P.T. 410 per kantar ; Abbassi, P.T. 380 per kantar ; Ashmouni, P.T. 310 per
                    kantar. The average price obtained for cotton in Egypt this year is P.T 350 per
                    kantar. I give below a translation of a communication of interest received from
                    Saad Bey Khalef, a wealthy landowner of Behera, one who is regarded as a judge
                    in matters per<hi rend="bold">taining </hi>to the cultiva­tion of agricultural
                    and cotton lands. He writes : ‘ I went to the offices of the Corpora­tion of
                    Western Egypt (in Cairo) and saw the samples of cotton, and found them very
                    good, especially the Afifi and Abbassi. Also I saw the samples of wheat and
                    barley, and found them wonderfully good, being the first year’s produce, and I
                    congratulate you on the good quality of the lands, as such good crops could not
                    be got the first year except from first-class land.” This evidence is
                    confirmatory of the statements respecting the quality of the soil made by the
                    Corporation’s manager in the Oases and geological expert, and announced to the
                    shareholders in a circular tetter some time since.- By order of the Board,</p>

                    account of the extraordinary fertility of its soil and its great climatic and
                    geographical advan­tages </p>
                <p>“Our methods of cultivation are antiquated. Now that agriculture as a science has
                    pro­gressed, we should be the first authorities on agriculture in the world, and
                    it is in every way our interest to profit by new discoveries which will enable
                    us to increase the total of our revenues and the yield of our crops. Bat it
                    would seem that European civilisation has progressed too rapidly among us,for
                    the scientific agriculturist has ended by considering him­self an inferior
                    being. Oar young people are devoted to law and medicine, and a lamentable state
                    of affairs has arisen. Longing for a pompons title or ornamental diploma, they
                    sacrifice the most vital interests, and we can only express our genuine concern
                    at the tendency that we note.” (“Al Minbar.”)</p>

                <p>Sir Augustus Hemming and Lady Hemming are leaving London for Egypt in a few days.
                    Sir Augustus was in the Colonial Office in Downi ng-street for thirty-six
                    yearsbefore he con­ceived a fancy for administrative work on the spot. About his
                    capability for such duties there could be not the slightest doubt From the
                    routine of the department he had risen to be recognised as one of its ablest
                    men, and had represented England on several boundary and other commissions.</p>
                <p>Sir Augustus’s first Governorship was that of British Gaiana, but he was not
                    there long when he was sent to Jamaica to succeed Sir Henry Blake, who had gone
                    out to Hong Kong. He was Governor at Jamaica for eight years, retiring in 1904.
                    Among other things, he did much to help West Indian cricket to reach its present
                    position. Although over sixty, he has not altogether lost the prowess he was
                    famed for when he kept wicket for the Gentlemen against the Players.</p>

                    pain of 1868. is staying at the Continental Hotel, Cairo. He was lieutenant of
                    the Chal­lenger during the survey expedition of 1872-76.</p>
