                    <head>THE FLEETS AT BREST.</head>
                    <p>The visit of the British Fleet to Brest and the
                    hearty reception accorded to our sailors by their
                    gallant hosts bring into a very pleasant
                    prominence the question of our relations with our
                    Continental neighbours. It was not always so.
                    The period of misunderstanding and ill-feeling,
                    though it may take an effort to recall it in the light
                    of the present rapprochement, is still so near to us
                    that an element of surprise inevitably mingles
                    with the thankfulness that we feel for the
                    complete and, we hope, permanent change. For
                    this change we are indebted not a little to the tact
                    of our King, so amiably reciprocated by the visit
                    of M. Loubet; and both nations have felt and
                    expressed their pleasure at the diplomatic
                    strength given to the union.</p>
                    <p>Under the present circumstances the visit of
                    our ships has a peculiar interest. The Continent
                    of Europe contains explosive elements, to say
                    nothing of the causes of mutual offence which are
                    so widely scattered over the face of Europe and
                    Asia, which no amount of friendly words render
                    innocuous. The strong man</p>

                    <p>armed must continue to be the ultimate ga-
                    rantee for the safety of his house. But it is
                    possible to distinguish between nations whose
                    interests and whose ambitions are fundament-
                    ally hostile to ours, and nations with whom
                    we have only some passing though irritating
                    occasion of difference. And we must remember
                    that for nearly five and thirty years it has been
                    the object of one of the Great Powers of Europe
                    to sow the seeds of discord between her rivals,
                    and to profit by maintaining a perpetual state
                    of irritation between peoples who might other-
                    wise have rested in peace and tranquillity.</p>
                    <p>The ingenious attempt to weaken the entente
                    which even the peacable M. Jaurés denounced
                    with the vigour of a militant patriot should
                    be as much a lesson to us, as were the earnest
                    and successful efforts made by France to keep
                    the peace without sacrificing her prestige or
                    her exceptional position in Morocco. Whatever
                    diplomatic success German interference in
                    Morocco may have won, the understanding
                    between France and England is in no way
                    weakened and the visits of the Squadrons
                    are, we hope, a sign that external interference
                    can only tighten the bonds between the two
                    great democracies of Western Europe. Admiral
                    May's message to the French Minister of
                    Marine expresses with nautical frankness what
                    politicians have at times ignored, viz., the
                    community of interests between the two nations
                    who find themselves face to face with a
                    formidable and hungry rival.</p>
                    <p>Although we are within a few weeks of the
                    centenary of the last great sea fight between
                    an English and a French fleet, and although in
                    another ten years there will have been a full
                    century of peace to seperate us from the great
                    French war, yet it cannot be denied that peace
                    between France and England has often been in
                    sore peril during the intervening years. Indeed
                    it seems but yesterday-and it is but little
                    more than two years ago-that war was
                    openly talked of between the two countries.
                    And yet there can be no possible doubt as to
                    the absolute sincerity of th joy with which
                    both nations have welcomed the happy
                    change which has come over the spirit of
                    their mutual relation. The population of 
                    Brest and the crowds of visitors to the grim,
                    grey old Breton port are as glad to see their
                    British guests as the people of Portsmouth
                    will be to welcome the French sailors when
                    they pay the return visit. The fact is that
                    there is no good reason, at this time of day
                    why England and France should not live in
                    peace and amity-while there are diverse very
                    weighty reasons why they should. Nowhere,
                    too, is that more keenly felt than on the
                    French coast, whose people have ever had to
                    bear the brunt of an English war. So Brest is
                    right glad to-day-and so are we.</p>

                    <p>Senor Villaverde made his mark in the first
                    Silvela Administration in 1899 as the kind
                    of statesman Spain needs. While his chief
                    was engaged in sketching ecstatic visions of
                    the Spain of the future the Finance Minister
                    devoted himself to the securing of sufficient
                    revenue to meet the national obligations and
                    carry on the system of Government. The
                    new supplies came in, but his efforts to se-
                    cure a permanent reduction of outlay provoked
                    violent hostility both in the army and navy,
                    nor was this hostility bought off by the retire-
                    ment of the Finance Minister, whose most
                    important success was the raising of a loan
                    of £48,000,000 to pay off the floating debt.
                    His successors were only too glad to attempt
                    in detail what he had endeavoured to achieve
                    on a large scale. Persisiting in his mission
                    to impress on his countrymen a rigorous
                    system of economy Senor Villaverde gained
                    so much ground that he was invited to form
                    a Cabinet in 1901 and though unsuccessful
                    that year became Prime Minister in 1902,

                    pink of condition, and the music was supplied
                    by the string band of the Royal Berks. Before 
                    the dance a large number of dinners were
                    served on the terrace.</p>
                    <p>SAN STEFANO CASINO.-The small dance
                    given at the Casino on Saturday was very
                    animated, a large number of people staying
                    after dinner. Yesterday morning's instrumen-
                    tal concert on the terrace was very largely
                    attended, as usual. Massenet's fist suite
                    d'orchestre was well executed, as was also
                    Beethoven's fifth symphony, which was greatly
                    applauded. Next Sunday, three singers from
                    Milan will make their debut. THeir repertoire
                    consists of selections from Italian operas. They
                    will by accompanied by the orchestra.</p>
                    <p>EDEN MUSIC HALL FRACAS.-Last Friday,
                    at about midnight, a quarrel broke out in
                    the Eden Music-hall. It appears that the
                    attitude of a part of the audience towards one
                    of the artistes provoked heated replies; a
                    scuffle ensued, and the confusion was increased
                    by one of the performers, a Frenchman, falling
                    in a fit. Had matters terminated ther, there
                    would have been nothing further to comment
                    upon, but we regret to state that Saghco-
                    lagassi Lynn of the Police and Fire Brigade,
                    who was present, seems to have made con-
                    fusion worse confounded by unnecessarily
                    drastic measure, which included the calling
                    in of a number of policemen who were order-
                    ed to draw their sword bayonets. Though
                    it seems, so far, that no serious injuries were
                    received in the affray, some French and
                    other foreign subjects were hustled, and
                    M. Gaston, M. Sinadino's chauffeur, brought
                    away some nasty bruises. An inquiry was
                    opened at the Gouvernorat at 3 p.m. on Sat-
                    urday, a delegate of the French Consulate, to
                    which complaints had been addressed, being
                    present. After a close investigation of the
                    facts it was finally decided that all papers re-
                    ferring to the affair should be forwarded at
                    once to the Ministry of the Interior, and that
                    Saghcolagassi Lynn should in the meantime be
                    suspended from the exercise of his functions.</p>

                    <head type="sub">THE CAIRO CELEBRATIONS</head>
                        <p>The festivities held in Cairo on Friday last
                        in celebrations of the 14th of July, were, as
                        we reported on Saturday last, a greater success
                        than ever. The Sharia Kamel, the principal
                        street of the Capital, assumed an appearance
                        of unusual gaiety throughout the day, and
                        though none of the shops were closed, it
                        appeared to be an occasion of holiday-making
                        for many of the French patriots. A number of
                        the larger houses and establishments were de-
                        corated with the tricolour, and after dark many
                        of them were simply but effectively illuminat-
                        ed. Amongst the chief of these we might men-
                        tion the offices of the Gas Company, Shepheard's
                        and the Continental HOtels, the French Agency
                        and French Consulate, and the Cercle Fran-
                        çais.</p>
                        <p>Receptions were held at 9 in the morning at the
                        French Consulate by M. Bosquet, and at the
                        Agency by M. Bonin, and it is needless to add
                        that both of these notabilities received their
                        many callers with their usual grace and
                        courtesy.</p>
                        <p>Towards sunset Sharia Kamel became great-
                        ly crowded, and when the triumphal arch
                        which had been erected at the Boulac entrance
                        to the gardens was illuminated, all the passers-by
                        stood still to admire it. From the centre of
                        the arch colourless electric globes had been
                        arranged in rays, on the top of the two
                        columns were similar lights set in circles,
                        and between them hung chains of coloured
                        globes.</p>
                        <p>On entering the gardens one passed along
                        an avenue of short columns, each one of
                        which, bearing the French arms, was brilliantly
                        lighted, and this led to the special pavilion
                        which had been erected for the reception of
                        the guests by M. Bonin, who is representing
                        M. de la Boulinière during the latter's absence.</p>
                        <p>To describe the scene which here met the
                        eye is a task of no little difficulty. The pavilion
                        was surrounded by a long string of Chinese
                        lanterns, the ends of which were attached from
                        the roof to columns some 8 feet in height.
                        The pavilion was lit by electricity and its walls
                        were prettily decorated with the French arms.
                        To the right was a special open-air theatre
                        which had been erected for a variety perfor-
                        mance by which the troupe of the Nouveautés
                        attracted many people, and also two bandstands
                        for the accomodation of the bands of the
                        Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Egyptian Cavalry,
                        and between these two stands was an asphalted
                        space which was reserved for dancing later in
                        evening. In front of these gas jets had been
                        arranged in various designs, which afforded an
                        exceedingly pretty contrast to the Chinese
                        lanterns, and on each side of the theatre was
                        an arch of coloured electric globes.</p>
                        <p>M. Bonin, on his arrival, was met at the
                        gates by the members of the committee and
                        was greeted by the playing of the "Marseillaise"
                        by the Egyptian Cavalry Band. On his ap-
                        proaching the pavilion the band of the Innis-
                        killing Fusiliers greeted him with the same
                        strains, and as he entered, the string band in
                        attendance continued the hymn. Next followed
                        the Khedivial Anthem and after that "God
                        save the King," both of which were played by
                        the three bands in succession.</p>
                        <p>The British nation was not only very fully
                        represented by those who had come primarily
                        in an official capacity, but nearly every Eng-
                        lishman who is in Cairo had come to take part
                        in the fête, and the bond of union which the
                        "Entente Cordiale" has established between
                        the two races was in great evidence.</p>
                        <p>The large number of invited guests were
                        received by M. Bonin with his usual cordiality,
                        and every hospitality was pressed upon them
                        by the members of the French colony who
                        assisted him.</p>
                        <p>The two military bands performed their
                        task with great credit, and their varied pro-
                        grammes were greatly enjoyed by all present.
                        The Nouveautés troupe, under the direction
                        of M. Lauri, gave their usual performance,
                        Mlle Mary Fleur, Mlle Liliane and M. Stephano
                        being especially deserving of the applause with
                        which they were wlecomed.</p>
                        <p>The pyrotechnic display was commenced
                        about 11.30 p.m. It was exceedingly unfor-
                        tunate that the fireworks had become damp,
                        and that in consequence the set-pieces were
                        by no means so good as they should have
                        been in their effect. Heavy clouds of smoke
                        almost hid them from view and choked the
                        spectators, but the smaller pieces left nothing
                        to be desired either as regards brilliancy or
                        noise caused by the explosion, which was almost
                        deafening. After the display of fireworks had
                        been concluded, dancing was indulged in by
                        many, the music being supplied by the
                        military bands, and this was kept up for a
                        cosiderable time. Two o'clock witnessed the
                        departure of a large number of people, but it
                        was not until after 4 p.m. that Cairo had
                        assumed its usual early morning calm.</p>
                        <p>The committee to whom had been entrusted
                        the work of organisation must indeed feel
                        very happy at the success with which their
                        efforts were crowned. All present enjoyed
                        themselves immensely, and the unanimous
                        opinion was that a more enjoyable evening
                        could not have been wished for. We therefore
                        do not hesitate to offer the committee, on
                        behalf of our readers, their best thanks for the
                        admirable way in which they performed their
                        task and our heartiest congratulations on
                        the results</p>
                        <p>The police authorities must also be con-
                        gratulated upon the order which was maintain-
                        ed among the large crowds which were
                        attracted by the illuminated arch, and the
                        streams of people which poured into the
                        garden until a late hour. The carriage traffic
                        was enormous, but the people were confined to
                        the footpaths as far as possible, and we believe
                        that in spite of the great crush no accident
                        occurred.</p>

                        European crew of his vessel. After describing
                        how the St. Kilda was sunk by the Dnieper
                        and the crew were taken on board the cruiser,
                        the captain of the British steamer continued:</p>
                        <p>"On our arrival at Port Said...the
                        commander of the Dnieper told us that he in-
                        tended to take us to Russia. 'We shall only
                        wait to take in coal,' he said,'before proceeding
                        on our voyage. You are our prisoners.' But
                        one of us managed to escape, and informed
                        the British consul of what had happened. The
                        captains of two English men-of-war, the
                        Lancaster and the Suffolk, came on board the
                        Dnieper with the British Consul, and demanded
                        our release.</p>
                        <p>"The commander of the Dnieper refused to
                        accede to the demand of the Consul, who left
                        the ship, accompanied by th ecommanders of
                        the Suffold and the Lancaster, after stating
                        that special measures would be taken if the
                        British subjects were not set at liberty within
                        an hour. A quarter of an hour later, when the
                        Lancastor raised anchor as if she were about to
                        approach the Dnieper, the Russian commander 
                        gave us permission to leave the ship, taking
                        with us our luggage."</p>

                        <p>(FROM A CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                        <p>The corrupt administration of the late Vali
                        of Beyrout had culminated in the sanguinary
                        skirmish between Christians and Moslems two
                        summers ago that threatened to develop into
                        a wholesale massacre. The advent of the present
                        Vali, Khalil Pasha, with all his moderation,
                        integrity, and general enlightenment, did not
                        soon dissipate the restlessness that continued
                        in Beyrout after the fanatical outbreak, and it
                        took some time before a normal course of things
                        was re-established and a reasonable understand-
                        ing between Christians and Moslems was
                        attained. But Beyrout seems to be doomed to
                        continual unrest. We had scarcely begun to
                        taste the quiet delights of security when the
                        Hamadé incident came to trouble our peace.</p>
                        <p>At one time it seemed to be the foreboding
                        of a reign of terror, for the arrest of Hamadé
                        Bey was followed by the ransacking of the
                        Moslem Onsi library, and a few Moslem and
                        Christian houses suspected of containing
                        revolutionary documents. This attempt on per-
                        sonal liberty, which even in Turkey is now
                        considered a sacred right, has been deeply
                        resented by all thinking Moslems. The recent
                        sweeping movement of racial independence on
                        the part of the Arabs in Yemen, with all its
                        glamour of ancient Moslem glories, was calcula-
                        ted naturally to evoke strong though silent
                        sympathies in the hearts of their Moslem
                        kinsmen on this side. The educated are begin-
                        ning to realise the unfitness of the Turk to
                        rule them, and chafe against his haughty
                        demeanour towards them, while they resent
                        his exclusive monopoly of Government offices.
                        As for the poor and illiterate, they cannot but
                        feel a stifled hatred of those who so mer-
                        cilessly oppress and bleed them. But the lack of
                        unity and homogeneity of race have always
                        barred the possibility of any organised move-
                        ment for freedom, while the adoption by the
                        diplomatic Turk of the faith of the conquered,
                        if only in form, has always acted as a strong
                        magnet that drew Islam to the Sultanante, de-
                        spite the repellent forces of despotism and
                        oppression.</p>
                        <p>Yet the recent events in Yemen have chang-
                        ed the aspect of things and inaugurated a
                        new era in the political life of Islam, having
                        served to stir latent dreams in the bosoms of
                        the Syrian Arabs and fuse the heterogeneous
                        elements of Islam in Syria into one common
                        feeling of religoius and racial solidarity, that
                        only blood and the old fascination of the
                        sword and the emblematic banner could evoke.
                        The tie of religion that has so far given the
                        illusion of brotherhood between the Turks and
                        Arabs (otherwise so far apart in language and
                        genius), has at last become loosened, and the
                        process of disruption is being slowly accom-
                        plished at least in feeling, if not in fact. For-
                        merly, no Moslem would confess to his hatred
                        of the Turk or his wish for the disappearance
                        of his rule, but lately such confessions have
                        not been uncommon and have been more freely
                        made to me as an Englishman and stranger on
                        his travels. This ferment could not elude the
                        attention of even the dull and obtuse Turk,
                        whose suspicions were more especially aroused
                        by the recent passive demonstration of sympa-
                        thy on the part of the Syrian soldiers in
                        Yemen. Wherefore the Government's vigilance
                        has lately been redoubled, and a greater de-
                        mand for the service of the spy manifested.</p>
                        <p>The Hamadé incident symbolises the wanton
                        system of espionage by which the Govern-
                        ment seeks to check the anti-Turk movement.
                        Hamadé Bey, though a quiet, inoffensive and
                        faitful Moslem, has been arrested chiefly
                        because of his relationship with the late
                        Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, the great exponent
                        of Moslem liberalism. During his stay in
                        Egypt as a zealous steamship agent he natur-
                        ally endeavoured wherever he went to use all
                        his persuasive powers to induce the Egypt-
                        ians to pass the summer in the Lebanon.
                        This laudable manifestation of a sense of
                        duty was so distorted and misinterpreted
                        by the salaried spies and calumniators of the
                        capital that it ended by eliciting an impe-
                        rial iradé of arrest. The officials charged
                        with the communication of the order of arrest
                        were friends of Hamadé Bey, and as the
                        latter landed and greeted them with unsus-
                        pecting friendliness they felt embarrassed and
                        finally explained to him the position with
                        the utmost kindness, while they led him off
                        to the seraglio to undergo an interrogation
                        and cross-examination at the hands of a
                        committee formed ad hoc. In the meantime
                        his luggage was seized and ransacked with
                        diligent care, but the most obnoxious thing
                        they could find was the well-known commen-
                        tary on the Koran by the late learned Sheikh
                        Mohamed Abdou. The Vali, a reasonable
                        and well-meaning gentleman, did his best
                        throughout to act in an equitable manner,
                        but in delicate situations of this kind pru-
                        dence sometimes dictates the sacrifice of cer-
                        tain qualms of the conscience, and it is
                        very doubtful whether the incident would
                        have closed so happily with the relase of
                        Hamadé Bey on the eighth day from his arrest,
                        had not friends of the prisoner interceded
                        successfully with the authorities at Constanti-
                        nople.</p>
