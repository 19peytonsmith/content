                    <p>THE PRESS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harold Spender’s article, which we published in oar issue of yesterday,
                        contrast curiously with Professor Flinders Petrie's summary of the situation
                        in Egypt. The editor of the "Westminster Gazette" leaves his antiquarian
                        rival far behind as far as style is concerned; but if we may adopt the
                        ordinarily metaphor suggested by the title of his article he has made rather
                        a hush of his deductions by the assumption that pigeons are regarded as more
                        or less sacred by the fellaheen. Were this the tenth some of oar Egyptien
                        confrères, who are now advocating the own version of the Japanese to Islam,
                        would do well to send missionaries to the provinces of Egypt to check the
                        growth of a dangerous superstition. Bat Mr. Spender does not realise—why
                        should he! -that the causes of the Deuishwai outbreak (lie deeper. Professor
                        Petrie has understood them clearly enough, and his quotation of the old
                        adage, “Set a beggar on horseback and he will ride to the devil,’’ appears
                        to us to explain the Danishwai outrage far better than any theories as to
                        the persistence of pagan beliefs as exemplified in the reverence with which
                        pigeons are said to be regarded by oar villagers. The fact is that, as we
                        recently pointed out, the rural population has in pertain districts got ont
                        of hand, owing to the absence of adequate penalties for perjury and assaults
                        on the parson: criminals of a low mentality are more likely to be affected
                        by any anti-foreign movement than any other section of the community, and
                        the assertion that, beoanse the fellah does not read newspapers, he is
                        therefore mentioned by the Pan-Islamio or Anti-Christian movement that has
                        been preached by some of oar soi-disant Nationalists, falls, owing to this
                        fact that some fellaheen read and that those who on read — oven with
                        difficulty-generously supply their friends with the fruits of their
                        erudition.</p>
                    <p>A column or two from "A1 Lewa” or “Al Umma,” painfully spelt out, goes a long
                        way with ignorant peasants.</p>
                    <p>A Cairo cotemporary denies the statement chat “U Papagallo il Masti” has been
                        suppressed. We hope the report to which we gave credence was founded on
                        fact; otherwise we cannot bat think that toleration has been carried rather
                        too far. After the Denishwai incident and the highly unpleasant symptoms
                        which the frontier dispute with Turkey produced, tolerance is more likely
                        than vigorous action to be ousted as a sign of weakness. Sir Edward Grey's
                        warning and Lord Cromer's comments, recently published in the Bine-Book
                        ladling with the frontier dispute, will appear rather brute fulmina

                            and enohaina the readers' attention by the vividness of its pictures,

                    <p>London, July 18.</p>
                    <p>Lady Curzon is dead. She had been suffering from complications, a sequel to
                        her illness of two years ago.</p>
                    <p>Lady Curzon of Kedleston (» Mary Victo- ria Leiter) was born at Chicago, and
                        the daughter of the late L. Z. Leiter, a plutocrat of that city. Her great
                        talents and beauty, which had already made her one of the most popular
                        debutantes in Washington society in 1891, added to the interest excited by
                        the announcement of her engagement to the Hon. G. N. Curzon, and her
                        marriage to him in 1895, in which year her husband became Under-Secretary of
                        State for Foreign Affairs. In 1899 she accompanied her husband to India. As
                        wife of the Viceroy she had naturally enough to contend with certain
                        jealousies aroused by her American origin or by the unpopularity of the
                        Viceroy among a certain section of Anglo-Indian officials, both military and
                        civil. That she succeeded in overcoming them was a great testimony to her
                        ability and personal oharm. She fulfilled the onerous social duties of her
                        position with remarkable taot and graciousness, and the news of her serious
                        illness twc years ago caused a widespread expression of sympathy. General
                        regret will be felt at her death, and not least in Cairo, where she was with
                        her husband the guest of Lord and Lady Cromer as lately as the 26th November
                        last.</p>

                    <p>Sayid Hassan Bey El-Akkad, a notable of Cairo, who has long been known as one
                        of the native leaders who appreciate the British Occupation in Egypt,
                        publishes a statement in the native Press, three columns in length, severely
                        criticizing "Al-Mokattam” for ascribing religious fanaticism to the Egyptian
                        people and threatening the Egyptians with severe measures. Sayid El-Akkad
                        concludes as follows: "Consequently, I have to advise my brethren the
                        Egyptians to put full confidence in the British Government, which does not
                        intend to do them any harm, but on the contrary wishes them every
                        prosperity. England is just and wise and it is unreasonable to suppose that
                        she will ever demolish with her own hands in a day the proud and splendid
                        fabric of reform which she founded, r quarter of a century ago, on the basis
                        of justice and freedom. Let us all show Tmrpelves quiet and peaceful ; let
                        ns put aside all useless agitation. As for ‘Al-Mokattam,’ which speaks in
                        the name of the Occupation of Egypt, that journal has no private relations
                        with the occupante, as the simple are led to imagine.” </p>

                        Japanese were now busily engaged in taking notes from both the Bible and the
                        Koran with a view to discover religious principles: “The Japanese are
                        inclining to the belief that there is but one God ; and the majority of the
                        learned and heads of religions in Japan undoubtedly lean towards Islam.” Wo

                    <p>RADICALS HARASSING SIR E. GREY. </p>
                    <p>The Radical members of Parliament exhibit a persistence in their
                        cross-examination of Sir Edward Grey regarding the Denishwai affair that is
                        worthy of a much bettèr object'than they have in view. Mr. J. MaoVeagh asked
                        the Secretary for Foreign Affaits upon what evidence the assertion of unrest
                        in Egypt at the present time was based ; and whether be would furnish a
                        return showing the number of prosecutions and convictions for offences of
                        violence against members of the Army of Occupation and European civilians
                        during the last five years. Sir E. Grey : I cannot undertake to have such a
                        return prepared. The statements I have made are based upon confidential
                        reports received from his Majesty’s representative at Cairo, extending over
                        several months. y Mr. MacVeagh asked under what section of the Native Penal
                        Code or the Special Decree of 1895 the sentence of flogging was passed in
                        the Deuishwai oases. Sir E. Grey : By Article 5 of the Decree of 1895, the
                        special tribunal has full power to inflict whatever punishment is èaosjdered
                        necessary without reference to the ordinary penal code. A translation of the
                        decree including this article will be included in the papers which have been
                        promised. Mr. Belloo asked whether this tribunal had power to torture. Sir
                        E. Grey replied that he was going to lay a translation of the deoree before
                        the House, and any question with reference to it could be raised afterwards.
                        Mr. J. Robertson asked whether it was not the case that the officers and
                        soldiers concerned had not been acting as members of the Army. Sir E. Grey
                        said he was not aware of that. Mr. MaoVeagh asked if the officers were
                        acting in their capacity as private individuals. Sir E. Grey replied that
                        they were in uniform, and therefore could not be considered as private
                        individuals. Mr. MacVeagh: Were they committing an illegal act in uniform 1
                        Sir E. Grey: No, they were not committing an illegal act. (Cheers.) In reply
                        to further questions by Mr. Mao- Veagh, Sir E. Grey said Lord Cromer, on
                        receipt of an application irom the genera) officer commanding, requested the
                        Ministry for Foreign Affairs to summon the Special Tribunal provided tor by
                        the Decree of 1895. It has not been suggested that the officers were guilty
                        of trespass. The Special Tribunal was instituted to take the place of
                        courts- martial ; to ensure that oases of this nature should be tried by
                        competent judges ac- quainted with the country, customs, and language of the
                        people; and, at the dame time, to prevent any possible miscarriage of
                        justice, by giving greater security to the accused than they would have had
                        if tried by courts-martial. Boutros Pasha was for many years Under-Secretary
                        of State at the Minis- try of Justice. I am not aware whether he has
                        previously officiated as a judge in a criminal case, but he is acting
                        Minister of Justice in the absence of the latter, and as such necessarily
                        presided over the Court. At the trial, after each witness had been heard,
                        counsel for the defense were invited by the Court to put any questions they
                        pleased. This is in accordance with the hope of criminal procedure in Egypt.
                        He hoped to present the papers in a fortnight. </p>

                    <p>The "Figaro” publishes a letter of protest from Mustapha Pasha Kamel
                        ccuoerning the Denishwai incident. Kamel Pasha deokres, ‘ in the name of all
                        that is sacred on earth,” that there is no ground whatever for the statement
                        made in the House of Commons by Sir Edward Grey with regard to toe existence
                        of religious fanaticism in Egypt. “Sir Edward Grey,” he says, “has been led
                        into error. If religious fanaticism existed in Egypt, how would it have been
                        possible for fifty-two Mussulmans to be tried by a court composed of four
                        Christians and only one Mussulman 1 Those who live in Egypt and •possess any
                        love for the truth knowery well that the Denishwai affair was not an anti-
                        European movement. We daim in itioe, equality, and liberty, and we desire to
                        have a Constitution giving us full power over our own affdrs. The friends of
                        liberty in England ought to expeot, as we do, that Egypt, which has given to
                        the world its highest civilization, shall not be a field of barbarity, but a
                        country where civilization and justice shall be as fruitful as the earth.”
                        In publishing Kamel pasha’s article the "Figaro” says : "We have not thought
                        it right to refuse the distinguished chief of the Egyptian Nationalist Party
                        the publication of his appeal against the somewhat summary proceedings of
                        English justice. But is Le himself sure of the impartiality of his judgment
                        against the English, and what other guarantee to his own words can he bring
                        to convince us that Sir E. Grey was wrong in his recent speech, when he
                        referred to the possibility of a disquieting awakening of Mohamedan
                        fanaticism 1 The agitation which has for some time teen prevalent in Egypt,
                        the Tabah affair in which Mnstapha Kamel Pasha admits the Nationalists were
                        on the side of Turkey, the present run of events in Tripoli, the recent
                        events in Morocco, and the unsettled conditions even in the depths of Africa
                        all tend to show that, on the contrary, Sir E. Grey was well advised in
                        requesting his Radical friends to refrain from making any demonstration
                        which in any way could calculated to encourage fanaticism.”</p>

                    <p>The semi-official reassurances published in Germany with regard to the
                        probable effect on German interests of the Abyssinian Agreement are received
                        in a somewhat skeptical spirit by many organs of the Press, which according
                        the "Morning Post’s” Berlin correspondent, construe the co-operation of
                        Italy with France and Great Britain as a fresh diplomatic defeat for
                        Germany. The “Tageszeitung” bitterly observes that Signor Tittoni is wiser
                        than was M. Delcassé, in that he nas imparted to his policy an appearance of
                        formal correctness by communicating its details to the German and Austro-
                        Hungarian Governments. The Agrarian organ ascribes to the new arrangement
                        farreaobing political consequences. Italy, it says, has pro- fitted one more
                        by the permission accorded her to indulge in an "extra dance." Her accord
                        with Great Britain and France may now bd considered perfect, and henceforth
                        the inter- national situation will he governed by the existence of a triple
                        alliance between the ally of Germany and the Western Powers. "What asks the
                        “Tageszeitung,” "will he the future attitude of Italy towards Germany I” It
                        proceeds to answer this question by in- sinuating chat the statesmen on the
                        Tiber will refrain from committing the blunder with which Chancellor Caprivi
                        inaugurated his assumption of office. They will endeavor to hold fast to
                        their reinsurance Treaty and to the Triple Alliance, knowing full well that
                        Germany, under existing (conditions, is pledged to protect their country
                        drum the aggression of other States, whereas they do not intend to fulfil,
                        in the event of war, their obligations towards Germany. This being so,
                        France and Great Britain can have no objection to Italy remaining a member
                        of the Triple Alliance. Germany, however, concludes the "Tageszeitung,” will
                        not evince much anxiety to renew a treaty of which she has tonier all the
                        costs while Italy reaps all the advantages. The “Kolnisohe Volkszeitong.’’

                        it expresses the conviction I that Italy will tacitly cease to be a member

                        of 20 percent. The shares were of £4 each because that was the denomination
                        dealt in on the Egyptian Bourse. The motion was agreed to, and a farther

                    <head>THE FASHN TRAGEDY. </head>
                    <p>A telegram received by Christo Nioolaou, brother-in-law of the woman murdered
                        at Fasbn, as already reported in our columns, reports that on Tuesday his
                        uncle, Yanni Toutourli, had been murdered. It was he who,according to onr
                        information, first Buspeoted Spiro Cotta as being the murderer of Mme
                        Nicolaou. It is necessary to recapitulate the whole history, of which we are
                        in possession, and of which this latest murder is the sequel. The late Spire
                        Nicolaou was a cotton-seed dealer, and he had matried a Mile Cotta, sister
                        to the brothers Lambro and Sotiri Cotta, of Alex- andria, who resided at 16,
                        Sesostris-street, and have a business at Shibin el Korn. On the 14th March,
                        Spiro Nicolaou, who snffered from his lungs, came down to Alex- andria and
                        was admitted to the nativehospital, much against thè^wishea of his wife, who
                        would have preferred to send him abroad, and declared that the Cottas were
                        too mean, although they had the money, to comply with her wish. As it was,
                        Spiro Nikolaou succumb- ed to an operation in hospital. His will, which he
                        made on bis death-bed, left all his money to his wife and brother, and an
                        annuity of 25 pounds to hia mother. This gave great umbrage to the Cottas,
                        who made out that h:s wife had prevailed upon him to make out the will in
                        her favour. A quarrel ensued, and a lawsuit followed, which necessitated
                        Christo’s presence at the Court of Alexandria. The Patriarchate of
                        Alexandria, pending the judgment of the Consular Court, sealed the property
                        of the deceased man. </p>
                    <p>The Scene of the Crime. </p>
                    <p>The dwelling occupied by the Nioolaou family was one common to Egyptian
                        country life. It was in two storeys, the mandra being oc- cupied by the
                        counting house and store-rooms for the cotton seed, and the upper rooms
                        being occupied by the family. Ahmed Gomaa, who has now disavowed his guilt,
                        was in the employ of the late Spiro Nioolaou. He seems to have been the
                        agent of Cotta, who paid him various sums of money to win him over. He is a
                        fellah Af the ordinary type. Spiro Cotta, who absolutely denied even knowing
                        Gomaa, was an Ottoman subjeot who, originating from Koritza, in Macedonia,
                        ob- tained recognition from the Egyptian Govern- ment four years ago as a
                        Helleuio subjeot The Consular authorities give a complete denial by our
                        informant that ha is a Turkish subject or Rayah. Cotta lived at an inn of
                        Fashn. </p>
                    <p>How the Crime was Committed. </p>
                    <p>Although he now completely disavows having committed the orime, Gomaa gave
                        be- fore the authorities of Minieh a detailed description of how the deed
                        was carried out, a description which ciroamstantial evidence wholly bears
                        out. On the night of the 25th June Cotta met him, and said he wished to
                        speak to him. They went off together, and Cotta told him that he wanted
                        toJrillMme Nioolaou, offering him one hundred pounds to do it Gomaa
                        oonsented and they returned to the house. On the way they were met by the
                        ghaffir", who, however, knowing Gomaa to belong to the place, did not
                        question the pair. As the women were still awake when they arrived, they
                        waited below in the mandra. It was late when the two began their horrid
                        work. Armed with a kitchen knife and a sleeve dagger, they soaled the wall
                        and reached the window of the room where the woman and her niece, a girl of
                        fourteen, slept. The woman was the objeot of their attack. Gomaa seized her
                        first and dealt her a stroke in the neck,but before he could finish her. her
                        startled ories had roused her niece, who closed on Gomaa from behind. Cotta
                        here interfered, and leaving the Arab to deal with the girl, cat the throat
                        of the woman, who rolled under the bed. Tbé girl was similarly dispatched
                        and fell beside the door, where the next morning she was found hud- dled up.
                        The ghastly work done, Cotta paid Ahmed the sum of thirty pounds which he
                        fonnd in the room, and promised the remaining seventy the next day. He then
                        returned to the hotel. The next morning, when the whole plaoe was in an
                        uproar, Cotta was fonnd fast asleep in bed, in 1rs clothes, and with his
                        registration paper in his pocket as if ready for flight. Moreover, be seemed
                        exceedingly merry and pleased with himself. When confronted with the
                        corpses, he said nothing, bnt changed connteDanoe. At Alexandria, before the
                        Con- sular Court, he denied completely all Gomaa had said but afterwards
                        seemed to be much affected, so much so that the Consul asked the reason. "I
                        don’t know,” was all he said. Gomaa and he are still under lock and key, and
                        the enquiry is proceeding. </p>
