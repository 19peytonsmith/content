                    <head>THE “POTEMKIN'S” CRUISE.</head>
                    <p>The “Kniaz Potemkin” continues her cruise and has levied a contribution on
                        the town of Theodosia, while the destroyers sent to pursue her appear to be
                        exploring the Roumanian coast. Admiral Kruger’s squadron has been rejoined
                        by the repentant “Pobiedonosets,” bat we should like to know the exact moral
                        and material condition of his division. Russian official wires explain
                        nothing; the “Kniaz Potemkin” surrendered, so they told us, a few days ago,
                        but there seems to be no doubt that not only did she refuse to haul down the
                        red flag but that the “Pobiedonosets” joined her for a time, forcing Admiral
                        Kruger to steam back to Sevastopol lest a worse thing should happen.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the rebellious crew of the battleship are steaming about the Black
                        Sea threatening seaports and Russian merchantmen and, so far, evading the
                        destroyers sent in pursuit The situation has been paralleled in South
                        America, and some of our readers may remember the Brazilian naval revolution
                        and the blockade of Rio by the "Melloist" fleet. But in the Brazilian
                        revolution the fleets of neutral Powers were able to safeguard neutral
                        interests and to protect neutral shipping. But the Black Sea is open to only
                        two fleets, the Russian and the Turkish, both disorganised, the one by
                        neglect and the other by revolt, and should the squadron of Admiral Kruger
                        be unable to check the depredations of the “Kniaz Potemkin” and the rebel
                        battleship help herself to coal or provisions at the expense of neutrals,
                        either the Turkish fleet will assume the duties of a policeman, or the
                        Powers may be obliged to send their ironclads up the Dardanelles. The last
                        alternative is the more probable, for a Turkish fleet capable of
                        encountering the redoubtable “Potemkin” could not be made ready for months,
                        but what a blow to diplomacy would be the overthrow of all the arrangements
                        that generations of Foreign Ministers and Chancellors have laboured to
                        secure ! The Sultan’s comments on the situation must be interesting.</p>

                        KHEDIVE.</head>
                    <byline>(From our own Correspondent.)</byline>
                    <dateline>London, June 29.</dateline>
                    <p>I have cabled you the principal points of the important speech which Lord
                        Cromer made to-night, when, as the guest of the Worshipful Company of
                        Skinners, he was entertained at a banquet in the Company’s Hall, Dowgate
                        Hill, after having received the honorary freedom of this Worshipful
                        Company.</p>
                    <p>The Master (Mr. G. St. John Roche) was in the chair, supported by, amongst
                        others, the Right Hon. W. C. Gully, M.P., the Earl of Kilmorey, Mr. Robert
                        Spencer, M.P., and others.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer, in the course of his response to the toast of his health,
                        proposed by the Chairman, said : It is not my duty te enlarge on the wider
                        and more general aspects of the agreement with France which was recently so
                        successfully negotiated by Lord Lansdowne, under whom it is my privilege to
                        serve,(cheers)—but I wish to say—and I think I can say it without
                        indiscretion—that it has been an unmixed benefit to all who have to deal
                        with the local affairs of Egypt, to be relieved from the constant friction
                        and annoyance which were the inevitable accompaniment of the state of
                        affairs which existed prior to the signing of that Agreement. (Cheers.) The
                        Worshipful Master has alluded in flattering terms to the part I have taken
                        in the regeneration of Egypt: I could have done nothing whatever without the
                        loyal and persistent co-operation of the Egyptian Government, and whilst I
                        am dealing with the Egyptian Government I take this opportunity of
                        mentioning that the story which has gone the round of the Press, and which
                        the Worshipful Master has repeated, in connection with my representations to
                        the Khedive as to the presence of British troops in Egypt, happens to be a
                        pure myth. No such incident as is alleged ever occurred, and my relations
                        with the Khedive are of the most satisfactory description. (Hear, hear.) I
                        was glad to hear the Master mention the Irrigation Department, because,
                        though it is invidious to mention names, I cannot refrain from alluding to
                        Sir William Garstin, who, by his assistance in connection with the control
                        of the water supply, has raised himself to the rank of one of the greatest
                        hydraulic engineers in this or in any other country.</p>
                    <p>NO NEED FOR HURRY.</p>
                    <p>The Master has spoken of the progress made in Egypt A good deal has been
                        done, but there remains much to do. There are a few conditions which I think
                        it is very desirable to secure if that progress is, as I hope, to be uniform
                        and steady. The first of these conditions is that we should not be in a
                        hurry. (Hear, hear.) Whatever good work has been done in Egypt has been to a
                        very great extent due to the fact that the action of the Government has been
                        deliberate, and that there has been continuity of policy extending now for a
                        long term of years. The second condition, which I hope also may be fulfilled
                        in the future as it has been certainly through several years fulfilled in
                        the past, is that Egyptian affairs shall be kept out of the somewhat
                        dangerous swirl of British party politics. (Cheers). The third condition,
                        which I hope will be fulfilled, is that, whilst every reasonable occasion
                        will be taken to profit by any real aptitude the Egyptians may show for the
                        management of their own affairs, great care and caution will be exercised
                        not to force Western ideas and exotic institutions on the Egyptians
                        themselves before the country is ripe to assimilate those ideas and
                        institutions. (Cheers). The fourth and last condition is that Egypt will
                        continue in the future as in the past, to be governed in the interests of
                        the Egyptians themselves. (Renewed cheers.) That, gentlemen, is a very sound
                        principle—a principle which, I venture to say, applies to other countries
                        besides Egypt. (Laughter and cheers). It is not only a just principle, but
                        one which I venture to think is conducive to the best political and
                        commercial interests of Great Britain itself.</p>
                    <p>COMMERCIAL GOOD MANNERS.</p>
                    <p>As I am speaking in the commercial capital of the world, I would like to say
                        something of commercial affairs in which I take a deep interest, not only
                        because it is my duty to do so, but also because I come of a family which
                        has for many generations been connected with the trade of the City of
                        London. The first remark I have to make is that, if in my new capacity of a
                        skinner I was going to trade in skins in Egypt, the first thing I would do
                        would be to Send out a commercial agent who had good manners, and who knew
                        some language besides his own, and who would find out what sort of skin
                        Egyptian customers wished to buy. (Much laughter.) If I venture to allude to
                        the subject of good manners, it is because it has always appeared to me that
                        good manners are almost as valuable an asset in commercial as in diplomatic
                        affairs. We must remember that we have to compete with the foreigner, not
                        only in respect of quality of goods, but as regards tact, judgment and
                        conciliatory address.</p>
                    <p>LOCAL COMPANY PROMOTION.</p>
                    <p>There is also the subject of finance, to which</p>
                    <p>I desire to allude. Some years ago we were</p>
                    <p>anxious to attract British capital to Egypt. For a long time British
                        capitalists turned a deaf ear. Confidence is a plant of slow growth in the
                        bosom of the investor, but when it once takes root it sometimes grows with
                        almost excessive rapidity, and whereas at the begin</p>
                    <p>ning we suffered from the first disadvantage, we are now suffering from the
                        second. Capital is now flowing from England and other countries rapidly into
                        Egypt, and provided, as is often the case, it is devoted to sound commercial
                        industry it is very welcome ; but we want no mere company mongering.
                        (Cheers.) We do not want companies whose share capital is watered to the
                        extent that all trace of the original spirit has almost entirely
                        disappeared. (Laughter and more cheers.) We shall certainly do our best to
                        resist the invasion of these gentlemen, but when I say we shall do our best
                        I ought to explain that neither the Egyptian nor the British Government can
                        do very much in that direction, nor can they exercise any effective control
                        unless laws and regulations are very stringent If they are not stringent
                        there is reason for fearing, and almost a certainty, that they will be
                        unfavorable to legitimate enterprise, and that commerce will be seriously
                        hampered. The public themselves must be their own principal guardians—(hear,
                        hear)—and those who are asked to invest in companies that are now floated, I
                        would advise to look carefully to facts, and to judge for themselves whether
                        au enterprise is a good one. Th<hi rend="underline">ere especially
                        </hi>would I advise them, in cases where quotations are made from official
                        and other reports, to go to the origin of those reports, and to see whether
                        the conclusions that can be drawn are in fact the conclusions that they are
                        invited to draw by the company promoters. In these circumstances the context
                        is often very important. I make these remarks, not with the view of driving
                        capital away, nor do I make them in condemnation of some companies which are
                        very good, but the British name has hitherto stood very high, and I should
                        be extremely unwilling that that name should be in any degree tarnished.

                        he was of the House of Commons, but not in it. He had to introduce himself,
                        as the gladiator in the arena, ‘ Ave Cæsar, morituri te salutant,” but from
                        information derived from the newspapers he understood that that was the last
                        time he would have the opportunity of responding to the toast of that branch
                        of the Legislature in which he had hitherto sat. (Laughter.)</p>

                    <head>THE LEBANON.</head>
                    <p>A Lebanon correspondent writes :—</p>
                    <p>One cannot help feeling a certain disappointment that the inhabitants of the
                        Leba- non, with all their good qualities, have not succeeded in ruling
                        themselves more successfully. There are some very commendable features in
                        the administration of the Lebanon Government. The roads are well looked
                        after, titles to land are honestly and carefully registered, and public
                        security is far better than in many parts of rural Egypt. But there are
                        certain disagreeable features which I should like to emphasise. Clerical
                        influence is not always an unmixed blessing, and in my opinion the strong
                        Maronite element in the Lebanon is inclined to allow too much political
                        influence to its priestly leaders. Moreover, some of the Emirs are inclined
                        to adopt a ‘family’ policy, claiming for their clans the monopoly of certain
                        posts. At present the disputes between the higher Maronite clergy and the
                        Mutassarif have led to a most deplorable amount of friction ; and while I do
                        not hold a brief for Muzaffer Pasha, who is doubtless a better soldier than
                        he is an administrator, I should like to point out that the Governor’s ideas
                        as to the government of the province are more advanced than those of many of
                        his opponents, and if he has shown too strong a liking for centralisation,
                        and a certain disregarded for public opinion, his opponents are in many
                        oases entirely wedded to the old system of keeping certain posts for members
                        of a certain religion quite irrespective of their abilities or merits,—a
                        system unfortunately sanctified by the constitution of 1860, which has
                        outlived its usefulness.</p>
                    <p>Thus we hear of the case of a sheikh who is not generally supposed to be a
                        shining example of honesty but is being vigorously backed by the clergy for
                        the kaimakamship of, say, the Metn ; we have the officers of the militia
                        forces appointed, not for their tactical ability or technical
                        qualifications, but for their religion. If Captain A. is a Maronite, Captain
                        B. must be a Druse, though he may be incapable of drilling a squad, much
                        less a company ; and this system prevails in almost every department of the
                        Government. That the system involves bribery and corruption goes without
                        saying. Some comment was recently aroused among Syrians residents in Egypt
                        by the case of an amazingly useless member of a Druse clan, who had sat for
                        some years in the Majlis el Idara, and who, finding his term of office
                        drawing to a close, determined to be re-elected. His family considered that,
                        brains or no brains, he had a right to his position ; several of the
                        Maronite members of the Idara had found him so pliable and useful a tool
                        that they resolved to support him. The Governor opposed the appointment, but
                        in vain ; certain venal sheikhs were paid £10 a head, and the incompetent
                        member was returned to the council, to the disgust of the few who realise
                        that such methods of election will never make the Lebanon prosperous or
                        contented, and can only increase the disunion that is still the bane of
                        Syria.</p>

                    <dateline>London, June 30.</dateline>
                    <p>Commemoration Day at Oxford was celebrated yesterday, the proceedings being
                        characterised by much dignity and decorum. The honorary degrees conferred
                        numbered only seven, as compared with 37 last year. The Sirdar, Sir Francis
                        Reginald Wingate, was among those honored with the degree of D.C.L.</p>
                    <p>Although the undergraduates were sparsely represented, the Sheldonian Theatre
                        was crowded, the fair sex being largely in the majority. Few incidents
                        occurred to enliven the proceedings before the arrival of the Vice-
                        Chancellor and the heads of Houses, an organ recital by Dr. Varley Roberts,
                        of Magdalen College, occupying the interval</p>
                    <p>At twelve o’clock, to the strains of the National Anthem, the
                        Vice-Chancellor’s procession entered and took their seats, and Convocation
                        was formally opened! The procession included the Vice-Chancellor, the Warden
                        of All Souls,’ the Dean of Christ Church, the Warden of New College, the
                        Rector of Exeter, the Provost of Oriel the President of Magdalen, the Senior
                        and Junior Proctors, Sir W. Markby, Dr. Ince, Dr. Bigg, Dr. Driver, Dr.
                        Butty, Dr. Burney, Dr. Dixey, Dr. Driver, Dr. Wilson, Dr. Holdsworth, Dr. R.
                        W. M. Pope, Dr. Whitmarsh, Professor Holland, Professor Esson, Professor
                        Napier, Professor Poulton, Professor Turner. Habitués of the Eicænia in
                        former years will readily appreciate the change which has come over the
                        scene by the feet that the Proctors walked across the theatre and took their
                        seats without a single expression of scorn or discontent, and that the Vice-
                        Chancellor was permitted to open Convocation without any sarcastic
                        references to his false quantities or parts of speech or exhortations to
                        “speak up” and “cut it short.” The recipients of the degrees met with a
                        cordial reception, Major-General Wingate, Governor- General of the Sudan, in
                        general’s uniform, his breast covered with glittering stars and orders,
                        Holman Hunt the artist, painter of the renowned Keble College picture,
                        “Light of the World,” and Paul Sabatier, the French savant securing the
                        heartiest applause.</p>
                    <p>Sir Thomas Raleigh, formerly Reader in English Law, in the absence of Dr.
                        Goody, Regius Professor of Civil Law, presented the recipients of the D.C.L.
                        degree.</p>
                    <p>Sir Francis Wingate was introduced as a distinguished and accomplished public
                        servant, a successful leader in war, who destroyed the power of the Khalifa
                        and restored his captives to their country. Sir Francis was now the chief
                        guardian of peace and leader of subject nations in the arts of peace, he had
                        re-built the cities of the Sudan, provided the people with schools, and
                        brought European science to the aid of the agriculturist. His services to
                        medical science, his exploration of Christian antiquities as far as the
                        border of Abyssinia, and his literary works, had given him additional claims
                        to honor.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the proceedings in the Sheldonian theatre, a numerous
                        and distinguished company was entertained at luncheon at All Souls’ College
                        by the Warden and Fellows, Sir Francisand Lady Wingate being among those

                    <head>SALVAGE OF THE ‘‘ASSOUAN.” FINDING OF ADMIRALTY COURT.</head>
                    <p>In the British Admiralty Court on the 28 th ulto. Mr. Justice Bargrave Deane
                        heard a claim by the owners, master, and crew of the Hamburg Amerika liner
                        “Ambria,” for salvage services rendered to the Khedivial mail steamship
                        “Assouan.”</p>
                    <p>It appeared that the “Ambria” found the "Assouan” in the Red Sea on March 9,
                        drifting about with a broken shaft. The disabled vessel had on board 1,000
                        Mecca pilgrims homeward bound from Jeddah. She asked to be taken in tow, and
                        the captain of the “Ambria” agreed to do so, and after towing for three days
                        brought the “Assouan” to safe anchorage in Suez roadstead. The owners of the
                        “Assouan” contended that the towage was of an easy character, and that, with
                        the exception of the broken tail shaft, their vessel was staunch and
                        seaworthy. Hence the Court was asked to fix the sum.</p>
                    <p>His Lordship said that in the experience of the Trinity Masters it was a
                        serious matter to take in tow a ship with a thousand pilgrims on board. The
                        services were well rendered, and he awarded £1,600.</p>

                        Alexandria and one death at Toukh. There are now 22 cases under treatment
                        The cases admitted to hospital in Alexandria were those of a Greek woman
                        living in the Kom el-Nadoura quarter, and a native girl of Abouchoucha,
                        another member of whose family was found dead on the 20th ult. One of the

                    <p>The members met, as usual at the breakwater on Saturday last at 4 p.m. The
                        attendance on this occasion was very good, there being no less than 19
                        active members present and four juniors. The afternoon’s meeting opened by a
                        club team race (16 yards) composed as follows. Team A : Messrs. Broscomb,
                        Ecclestone, Grant, Lupton, Potts, and Wood. Team B : Messrs. Borman, Darton,
                        Hemgell, Mace, Webb, and another. The race was very keenly contested by both
                        sides, and resulted in a win for Team B by about 10 yards.</p>
                    <p>A 30-yards dub race for the junior section was then held and ended in an easy
                        win for Master Randall, Master Mitchinson coming in second, closely followed
                        by Master Naser.</p>
                    <p>A water polo match was played off between two teams recruited on the spot,
                        and classed as Teams A and B, Team A carrying the day by 4 goals to one.
                        Team A had one goal cancelled for scoring while touching.</p>

                        <head>QUESTIONS MUNICIPALES</head>
                        <head>Le quai-promenade </head>
                    
                    <p>Les avantages que devait procurer à la ville la création du quai-promenade se
                        traduisent pour le moment en un redoublement d’ennuis pour les habitants.
                        Depuis cinq ans les terrassements qui n’ont pas été foulés et qui
                        proviennent en grande partie d anciennes catacombes sont incessamment
                        balayés par les vents du nord et couvrent toute U ville de nuages de
                        poussière. Nous avons demandé cent fois à la Municipalité, au nom du public,
                        de faire passer le rouleau compresseur sur ces terres mouvantes et d’arroser
                        de temps à autre; mais, comme d’habitude, notre réclamation est demeurée
                        sans résultat. En attendant le contribuable même le plus pauvre est
                        contraint <hi rend="italic">manu militari</hi> de verser le deux pour cent
                        pour l’as sainissement de la ville, qui n’a pas encore reçu un commencement
                        d’exécution.</p>
                    <p>Les Egouts </p>
                    <p>La plupart des égouts dégagent une odeur pestilentielle à tel point qu’il est
                        impossible de passer dans certains quartiers, même des plus riches, sans se
                        boucher le nez. Comme si une telle négligence ne suffisait pas à
                        compromettre la santé publique, la Municipalité n’hésite pas, sans aucun
                        avis préalable, à faire vider les fosses à fonds perdu pendant la nuit, sous
                        les fenêtres des habitants riverains qui à cette époque de chaleur
                        étouffante ont la coutume de laisser leurs croisées ouvertes pour dormir. A
                        ce propos qu’il nous soit permis de faire remarquer à nos édiles que
                        l'assainissement d’Alexandrie a été décidé depuis treize ans, que le
                        Gouvernement verse régulièrement à cet effet une annuité et que les
                        Alexandrins paient le <hi rend="bold">2</hi> % dans le même but. Or rien n’a
                        été fait jusqu’ici pour l’assainissement de la ville qu est aussi mal
                        drainée que jamais. C’est un avis pour les prochaines élections !</p>
                    <p>Occupation de la voie publique </p>
                    <p>plus que jamais nous sommes persuadés que les réclamations du public et des
                        journaux sont peu appréciées par l’administration qui, en face de la
                        nonchalance et du désintéressement de la population, se croit libre d’en
                        user comme bon lui semble. Nous avons souvent parlé de l’occupation abusive
                        de la voie publique dans les quartiers et les rues les plus fréquentés, tels
                        que la rue Attarine, la rue Franque, larue Midan pour ne parler que des
                        principales. Nos plaintes n’ont rien changé à l’état de choses actuel.
                        Dernièrement encore nous signalions le marché qui s’est installé entre la
                        Bourse Khédiviale et l’Immeuble du Crédit Lyonnais. Au lieu d’y remédier en
                        partie, l’administration a accordé de nouvelles concessions. La
                        Municipalité, comme on le voit, en use à son aise, mais cette désinvolture
                        pourrait ne pas durer éternellement.</p>
                    <p>L'encombrement des Rues </p>
                    <p>A la question de l’occupation de la voie publique se rattache l’encombrement
                        des rues. La manœuvre des voitures se trouve si mal dirigées par nos
                        chaouiches qu’un piéton doit quelquefois atteindre dix minutes pour
                        traverser une rue, s’il ne veut pas se faire écraser. Cet encombrement se
                        produit surtout dans la rue Chérif au niveau de la Bourse. Il serait à
                        désirer que l’allure des chevaux y fût au moins modérée pour éviter les
                        accidents.</p>
                    <p>Des credits ! toujours des credits ¡</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>La Municipalité nous distribue continuellement des listes de crédits qu’elle
                        a décidés, mais elle se garde bien de nous expliquer l’utilité et l’usage de
                        ces crédits.</p>
                    <p>D’un côté, par exemple, elle vote des crédits pour des fouilles
                        problématiques et de l’autre elle bazarde les blocs de la Tour des Romains
                        et fait jeter à la mer les merveilleux débris d’un temple grec qui sont deux
                        monuments authentiques. Elle fait baisser et hausser les niveaux des
                        terrains à son gré contre toutes les règles de l’hygiène et de l’esthétique,
                        sans en fournir aucune explication plausible et à cet effet elle destine
                        plusieurs milliers de livres. Il n’est plus question que de crédits à tort
                        et à travers; on prélève sur le budget ordinaire et sur le budget
                        extraordinaire. Mais de travaux utiles et hygiéniques nous n’en entendons
                        jamais parler.</p>
                    <p>Dans de telles conditions, il est à souhaiter que le gouvernement soit
                        attentif à n’approuver qu’à bon escient les innombrables votes de crédits
                        auxquels se livre la Commission Municipale.</p>
                    <p>La charte des loyers </p>
                    <p>Nous ne demanderons pas à la Commission Municipale, c’est-à-dire, aux
                        propriétaires d’immeubles et de terrains de se nuire à eux mêmes en faisant
                        avancer cette question vers une solution quelconque. Il est, en effet, de
                        l’intérêt de la Commission Municipale, c’est-à- dire des propriétaires, de
                        s’opposer par tous les moyens en leur pouvoir à la construction rapide de
                        nouveaux immeubles qui ne seraient pas de leur propriété. Il faut toujours
                        que la demande se maintienne supérieure à l’offre.</p>
                    <p>Moins il y a de maisons, et plus les loyers sont chers. Aussi les conseillers
                        municipaux sont actuellement au comble de leurs voeux, et la question de la
                        vente des terrains du quai, qu’ils ont réussi à retarder jusqu’à maintenant,
                        n’est pas encore tranchée. Mais si nous ne pouvons qu’approuver la conduite
                        de la Commission Municipale qui gère à merveille ses intérêts, nous ne
                        saurions en dire autant de la Commission des Locataires s’adressant à des
                        conseillers, ses ennemis, pour en obtenir un concours financier.</p>
                    <p>La centenaire de Mohamed Aly </p>
                    <p>Tout le monde a remarqué le beau coup d'oeil qu’offrait du péristyle de la
                        Bourse le piédestal et le statue du grand conquérant égyptien au milieu de
                        la Place des Consuls, avant la construction de la vespasienne qui ne laisse
                        plus apercevoir du grand homme que la tête ornée du turban. Notre
                        Municipalité a supprimé tous les urinoirs de la ville pour les
                        quintessencier en deux vespasiennes sur la Place des Consuls, sans doute

                    <p>PHENOMENAL SUBSCRIPTIONS. COMPANY’S HOPEFUL FUTURE.</p>
                    <p>The statutory meeting of the Egyptian Trust and Investment, Limited, was held
                        at the Institute of Chartered Accountants on the 29th ulto., the Chairman
                        (Sir Walter Bailer, K.C.M.G., F.R.S.) presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. Geo. T. Broadbridge, F.C.I.S.) having read the notice
                        calling the meeting,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said : Gentlemen, this being a formal statutory meeting all that
                        is strictly required of me is information that the requirements of the
                        Companies Act have been complied with, and that we have now a legal
                        existence as a company. But I intend to go a good deal further. After giving
                        you a brief account of our operations up to date, I propose to indicate, for
                        the information of the shareholders, the future policy of the board and to
                        give a forecast of the prospects of the company. I may state for your
                        information that the Egyptian Trust and Investment, Limited, was registered
                        on March 29th last, with a nominal capital of £200,000, in £1 shares. The
                        prospectus was published on April 10th, and the shares were issued
                        simultaneously in England and Egypt. Owing to the enormous number of shares
                        applied for the list in London was closed on the first day, being only kept
                        open till the arrival of the post on the following morning for the
                        convenience of country subscribers. The response was something phenomenal,
                        the total applications amounting to close upon eleven millions sterling. The
                        exact figures were : England, £1,015,237 ; Egypt, £9,759,449 ; total,
                        £10,774,686. So that our modest capital of £200,000 had been applied for
                        fifty-five times over, a success, I believe, quite unprecedented in company
                        history in this country. We are informed that in Alexandria and Cairo there
                        was a tremendous rush at the banks from first to last, and that at the
                        closing hours a considerable number of intending applicants were unable to
                        gain admittance. The response on the part of the general public in Egypt was
                        very representative, comprising financial and commercial circles, Government
                        officials, administrators and private individuals of all nationalities. The
                        task of allotment was, as you may suppose, not an easy one, and occupied the
                        board the best part of five days. But having laid down, with the assistance
                        of our solicitors, general broad principles to guide us, we worked the
                        business out accordingly, and settled the final distribution on a percentage
                        basis ; and, although the task was a difficult one, I think we succeeded, in
                        the end, in giving very general satisfaction. My colleague Mr. Weston went
                        out to Alexandria to assist the local board in making a simultaneous
                        allotment out there, and the whole business was carried through
                        expeditiously and without a hitch of any kind. There are now about 3,700
                        shareholders in the company. This phenomenal flotation was no doubt due to a
                        variety of favorable causes, but I do not hesitate to say that the chief
                        factor in our success was the presence on our prospectus of the name of Mr.
                        Pericles Glymenopoulos, of Alexandria, at the head of our advisory board in
                        Egypt. He is a powerful financier and a local expert of considerable
                        experience and influence. He has taken the company up with great enthusiasm,
                        having quite put his soul into it ; and I do not think we could wish for a
                        better guarantee of its future success. You will, I am sure, realise that I
                        have a strong board of colleagues, all able men, who are giving very close
                        attention to the business we have in hand, Our company proceeds on the sound
                        principle of paying its directors and its chief administrative officers, in
                        part, by results—that is to say, by a small percentage on the profits after
                        the shareholders have received a clear dividend of 10 per cent. ; and I look
                        forward with confidence to our participation with you, at the right time, in
                        a very substantial profit. Speaking on their behalf, and on my own, I may
                        say that we shall do our best to justify by results the generous confidence
                        and support extended to us on this occasion by the public both in Egypt and
                        here. It is my melancholy duty to record that, since the incorporation of
                        the company, one of my colleagues, Mr. Charles Cammell, died somewhat
                        suddenly during a visit to Marseilles for the benefit of his health. Whilst
                        deploring his loss, your board has not thought it necessary, for the present
                        at any rate, to fill up the vacancy. Your directors have been fortunate
                        enough to secure the exclusive services for five years, as general manager,
                        of Baron de Kusel ( Bey), who was formerly Controller-General of Egyptian
                        Customs. He is a man of exceptional business qualifications, added to which
                        he has had 25 years’ experience of public life in Egypt. I am glad to say
                        that he is present to-day, and that you will have shortly the pleasure of
                        hearing him speak. His advisory directors are Mr. Glymenopoulos, of whom I
                        have already spoken, and Mons. Jean Joannides, a director of the Bank of
                        Athens and a man of large commercial experience. On May 2nd an official</p>
                    <p>quotation was unanimously voted by the Alexandria Stockbrokers' Association,
                        and (according to the “Egyptian Gazette”) the announcement was received with
                        loud acclamations. </p>
                    <p>On our Stock Exchange a special settlement was granted for June 21. I am
                        aware that an Egyptian expert, whose opinion is entitled to the highest
                        respect, considers that we have entered the field just five years too late.
                        We think otherwise. We are advised and believe that we have commenced at the
                        very right moment—not a day too soon nor a day too late. We see great
                        opportunities before us, and we intend to make the most of them. We have
                        come to the conclusion that, as of old, ‘ there is com in Egypt,” and we
                        intend that, if possible, you shall have a full share of it. I may state for
                        your information that, although we have only been in active existence for
                        scarcely more than two months—for our certificate entitling us to commence
                        business is dated April 17—we have already earned money. With what we have
                        actually received and could immediately realise the directors were in a
                        position, had they so desired, to declare an interim dividend on the whole
                        of your paid-up capital. It would not height for me to disclose business
                        negotiations that are now in progress, and I do not want to appear too
                        optimistic, but I think I may confidently say that what we have done in the
                        past is a mere earnest of what we hope to accomplish in the future. If there
                        is one question that has been asked me by shareholders more than any other
                        since our formation, it is this, “What do you intend to do as a company, and
                        how will you make money ?” Well, without showing too much of our hand, I
                        think we may give a general answer to that question, which is a very natural
                        one from those who have invested their money, but before doing so I will
                        invite your attention for a few moments to our field of operations—“Egypt,
                        the Gateway of the East.”</p>
                    <p>I hope many of you have had an opportunity of reading Lord Cromer’s recent
                        voluminous report to His Majesty’s Government on the administration and
                        condition of Egypt and the Sudan for 1904. It is not only most interesting
                        reading, but it records a really marvellous economic development during one
                        short year. As a thoughtful writer in the “Investors’ Chronicle” has well
                        remarked “The economic progress under Lord Cromer’s rule is a remarkable
                        tribute to England’s administration, as well as an ample justification of
                        our intervention in 1882,” and he proceeds to give some interesting
                        particulars. In the time of Augustus, 54 B.C., the population of Egypt was
                        computed to be 18,000,000 ; at the present time the total is scarcely more
                        than half that number, of which 5,700,000 inhabit Lower Egypt. Of the lands
                        in Egypt, perhaps only 13,000 square miles are habitable, and of the
                        cultivated area, 5 1/2 millions of acres in all, one- half lies in the
                        Delta. As stated in our prospectus, the development of Egypt is making
                        phenomenal strides, due to the cumulative effect of British reforms. Large
                        areas of land are being reclaimed. Basin flooding is giving way to perennial
                        irrigation, and the productivity of the soil considerably augmented, The
                        country is benefiting by the improvement in railway communication. Towns are
                        developing at a great rate, building sites are being eagerly sought after,
                        and the population is increasing rapidly. The future of Egypt is no doubt
                        bound up with the proper administration of its land, so as to secure the
                        highest productiveness of the soil, to which, indeed, under a judicious
                        system of irrigation, there seems almost no limit. The staple product is
                        cotton ; but sugar, rice, maize, wheat and other crops may be cultivated
                        with considerable profit.</p>
                    <p>Commenting upon the marvellous progress made of late years, Lord Cromer in
                        his report reviews the position thus :—“The most satisfactory feature in the
                        Egyptian financial situation is the continuous growth of the revenue, in
                        spite of the large reductions of taxation which have taken place. In
                        1883—the first complete year after the British occupation—the revenue was
                        slightly under nine millions. This sum was collected with difficulty. The
                        revenue steadily rose until, in 1890 the figure of 10 millions was exceeded.
                        In 1897 a figure over 11 millions was attained. Continuing to rise with ever
                        increasing rapidity, a revenue of close on 12 millions was collected in 1901
                        and 1902, in spite of the fact that during the latter of these two years the
                        Nile flood was one of the lowest on record. In 1903 the revenue amounted to
                        12 1/2 millions, and in 1904, as I have already stated, the unprecedented
                        figure of LE. 13,906,000 was realised.”</p>
                    <p>On the subject of irrigation Lord Cromer writes :—“The two dams across the
                        Nile, at Assouan and Assiout, cost L.E. 3,237,000. Up to the end of 1904 a
                        sum of LE. 1,757,000 had been spent on subsidiary works in Middle Egypt,
                        which must be constructed before the full measure of beneficial result can
                        be derived from the construction of the dams. The total area so far affected
                        is about 1,276,000 acres. The increased annual rental of these lands is
                        estimated at about LE. 1,553,000, their increased sale value at about L.E.
                        15,730,000. About 205,000 acres of land formerly watered by the
                        basin-irrigation system have been adapted to perennial irrigation. About
                        246,000 acres remain to be similarly</p>
                    <p>treated. It is estimated that the work of converting the remaining 246,000
                        acres will cost about L.E. 1,424,000, and that at the present rate of
                        expenditure the work will be competed in 1908. Thus, Sir William Garstin
                        says, “for an expenditure of some 6 1/2 millions by the end of 1908 the
                        annual rental value of the land affected in Middle Egypt should be increased
                        by LE. 2,637,000 and its sale value by L.E. 26,570,000. I doubt if, in the
                        records of engineering work another instance can be quoted of such results
                        being achieved with so relatively small an outlay of capital.” After dealing
                        exhaustively with every aspect of the Egyptian question, His Excellency
                        gives a gentle word of warning</p>
                    <p>“Nevertheless, it would be certainly over- sanguine to rely with any degree
                        of confidence on the material progress of the country continuing at the same
                        rate as that of 1904. I venture to make this remark because just at present
                        there is but little risk of too pessimistic a view being taken of the
                        Egyptian situation generally. Indeed, judging from the very high prices
                        asked, and often obtained, for land, both rural and urban, and from other
                        indications, there would appear to be some risk of Egyptian public opinion
                        running to the other extreme—namely, that of somewhat exaggerated optimism.
                        But in making these remarks I do not wish it to be inferred that, in my
                        personal opinion, the present price of land, and especially of agricultural
                        land, in Egypt is inflated, and that there is likely to be a heavy fall.”
                        The main object of the company so far has been the acquisition of land. The
                        company’s first deal has been most successful and profitable. A block of
                        land purchased on advantageous terms has just been disposed of for a profit
                        of £5,400, and this in the space of only a few weeks. The company has
                        acquired several large plots of building land at Ramleh, at exceedingly low
                        prices, all of which could be resold to-day at enhanced figures. The
                        directors have no intention of disposing of them at present—on the contrary,
                        they are acquiring more land in the immediate neighbourhood, and the
                        intention is to eventually lay out the same in small building lots and to
                        run roads and streets through the property, thus considerably enhancing the
                        value of the land. The company has been fortunate enough to secure a
                        participation in the purchase of a large area of building land (50 acres) in
                        one of the best positions in Alexandria, which has been secured at an
                        exceedingly low rate, and the company should be able to realise quite easily
                        £10,000 to £12,000 profit on the sale of this property. Other business of a
                        very promising kind is now before the board, but it would be premature to
                        say anything about it at this meeting. Without in any way wishing to detract
                        from the value of other similar companies lately established in Egypt. I
                        think that the facts now placed before the shareholders will convince them
                        that this company has succeeded in securing some very satisfactory and
                        profitable deals, and at exceptionally low prices. Our success in the future
                        ought to be even more phenomenal. Egypt is, in fact, developing by leaps and
                        bounds. There is a daily stream of immigration into the country. Houses are
                        springing up everywhere, the price of building land is increasing a
                        hundredfold, and builders cannot compete with the demand for houses, The
                        town of Alexandria is rapidly developing, and very soon there will be a
                        chain of houses all the way to Ramleh, which is a suburb of Alexandria, at
                        which place the company owns several large plots of building land, purchased
                        at exceptionally low prices, and upon which a very handsome profit should
                        eventually be made. Well, gentlemen, I think I have said enough to make
                        shareholders who have not been tempted to sell their shares for a small
                        premium quite satisfied with themselves. Before I sit down I may add that
                        the board has not yet decided when to make a call <hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                        but that any shareholders may receive bearer warrants on paying up their
                        shares in full</p>
                    <p>Baron de Kusel (Bey) : After the interesting and elaborate statement which
                        you have just heard from the chairman I do not think there is much left for
                        me to say, although possibly you may look to me, as general manager, to give
                        yon some information respecting the present outlook and the present prospect
                        of the company’s affairs in Egypt. In the first place, I can fully confirm
                        all that the chairman has said, and, as an old Anglo- Egyptian, knowing the
                        country thoroughly, I can conscientiously say that at no period within my
                        recollection has Egypt appeared so prosperous as at the present moment, and
                        there is no reason why it should not continue so. I firmly believe that we
                        are only at the commencement of an important movement in connection with the
                        development of land enterprises in Egypt, and those who are fortunate enough
                        to acquire lands at the present moment at reasonable prices will undoubtedly
                        be able to dispose of same at considerably enhanced figures. I am
                        exceedingly optimistic with regard to the future of Egypt—the wonderful
                        development which has taken place the last few years has simply been
                        marvellous ; what is taking place daily is astonishing. There is a large and
                        continual stream of immigration into the country. I do not mean immigration
                        in the ordinary sense of the word. What I mean to say is that large numbers
                        of well-to-do Syrians, Armenians, Greeks, etc., are arriving in Egypt daily
                        from Asia Minor and the Levant. A number of them have a certain amount of
                        capital at their disposal, and as they are generally very astute and
                        exceedingly clever men of business, they have one and all entered the lists
                        as purchasers of building and agricultural land. This naturally tends to
                        enhance prices, and, after all, there is only a limited area of building
                        land in and around Alexandria. It is obvious, therefore, that prices must
                        continue to advance to phenomenal, if not exaggerated, limits. I am merely
                        referring to Alexandria at the present moment, but it is evident that what </p>
                    <p>is taking place there will be repeated in and. around Cairo, as well as in
                        the Sudan. Latterly one or two local Egyptian companies have been formed,
                        all the capital being subscribed by a few local magnates, the primary object
                        being the acquisition of building land, and consequently more competitors in
                        the field. I think I may say that your company has been singularly fortunate
                        in having Mr. Glymenopoulos on the advisory board in Egypt. He is a
                        gentleman whose social and financial position is second to none. He is,
                        moreover, considered one of the best experts in the valuation of land in
                        Egypt. His eminent qualities and good, sound judgment have been proved by
                        the brilliant acquisition of the different parcels of land acquired by your
                        company on his advice—on most advantageous terms. Mr. Glymenopoulos and his
                        friends hold an exceedingly large interest in this concern. He has done his
                        utmost to further the interest of the Egyptian Trust, and I think the
                        shareholders may rest assured that he will strain every nerve and give all
                        his assistance towards making this company a great financial success. There
                        are other companies doing business in Egypt on similar lines to your own,
                        but I believe I am justified in saying that it has been left to this company
                        to take the lead in being able to put before their shareholders at a
                        “statutory meeting” such a favorable and satisfactory statement as that
                        which yon have just heard from the chairman. Your company has certainly
                        scored not only on this point, but also in having <hi rend="bold">been
                        </hi>fortunate enough to acquire the lands now held at such exceptionally
                        low prices. In confirmation of this statement, I may say that I received a
                        few days ago an offer to purchase all the land actually held by your company
                        at prices which, if, accepted would leave you a profit of at least 20 per
                        cent. The advisory board are not prepared to recommend the directors to
                        accept this offer, although it sounds attractive, for the simple reason that
                        they foresee higher prices later on. In conclusion I may just mention that
                        there are one or two important deals under consideration, and, when matured,
                        they will be placed before your directors for their consideration. Should
                        they be adopted, and as they appear to be eminently profitable there is no
                        reason why they should not be favorably entertained, I think I might venture
                        to predict a far and wide reaching effect upon the company’s shares, and it
                        would not surprise me to see them quoted at a considerably higher premium
                        than they are to-day.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then invited questions. He trusted that the shareholders would
                        be satisfied with the report, and realise that the board were doing their
                        best for the company.</p>
                    <p>There being no questions, General Lance, in moving a vote of thanks to the
                        chairman for presiding, said that he had been in Egypt during the last two
                        winters, and was in Cairo whenthe company was floated, and he could confirm
                        all the statements which the chairman had made.</p>
                    <p>The motion was seconded and carrried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The proceedings then terminated.</p>
                    <p>FOOLED ARAB BANDITS. </p>
                    <p>The “Dépêche Tunisienne” tells an amusing anecdote.</p>
                    <p>A traveller from Djerba, the island of lotus-eaters, left Ben-Gardane for
                        Zarzis, mounted on a donkey laden with merchandise and a sum of money. After
                        having gone a certain distance he was stopped by two Arabs, who demanded his
                        purse or his life.</p>
                    <p>Terribly alarmed, the traveller at once gave up his merchandise, donkey and
                        money, after which he climbed rapidly up a neighboring telegraph post and
                        placing his month near the wires hailed the officer commanding the
                        detachment at Ben-Gardane. He said that he was being robbed and asking for
                        immediate help.</p>
                    <p>The Arabs, surprised, knowing with what rapidly a telegram is transmitted,
                        but not understanding very well how, were half inclined to believe that the
                        detachment would arrive by the wires. They immediately returned the objects
                        stolen, but refused to depart until the traveller had countermanded the
                        demand for help, which he did in a load voice.</p>
                    <p>THE X-RAYS’ LATEST. </p>
                    <p>Net content with revealing the skeleton in the human cupboard, the X-rays
                        have now proceeded, in the hands of Professor Rieder and Dr. Joseph
                        Rosenthal, of Munich, to take artistic pictures of the lungs and heart. The
                        patient held his breath while his lungs were photographed in less than a
                        second, and afterwards, though the patient could not stop the beating of his
                        heart, the operators took their photograph of it so quickly, in one-tenth of
                        a second, that they succeeded in catching it between the beats. The results,
                        no doubt, will be of considerable scientific interest and importance, but in
                        this respect at least the popularisation of science should surely be kept
                        within limits. Pictures of the inner man displayed for popular inspection
                        may not be altogether to the good in an age when so many of us are addicted
                        to physical introspection to a degree that is not beneficial either to our
                        peace of mind or to our health. Behind all looms a terrible prospect of a
                        time coming when the snapshot fiend will be able to turn on his X-rays Kodak
                        and display the hearts of favorite statesmen and actresses in the
                        magazines.</p>
