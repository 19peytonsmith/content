                    <head>THE KHEDIVES DECLARATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The interview granted by the Khedive to a French journalist, a translation of
                        which will be found in another column, has attracted a considerable amount
                        of attention, and a section of the home Press is by no means inclined to
                        accept with a good grace His Highness’s neglect to mention the share of
                        Great Britain in the development of this country, which he described in such
                        feeling terms to M René Puaux. There is no reason for those who are in touch
                        with local politics to exhibit any surprise at this omission. If the warmest
                        expressions of gratitude to the Occupation had flowed from the Khedive’s
                        lips, and he had made the most sincere acknowledgment of the obligations
                        Egypt was under to Lord Cromer’s administration, his Highness’s declarations
                        would in all probability have been branded as remarkable examples of
                        Oriental duplicity by the "Times,” while they would have been received with
                        silent indignation by the Moslem Nationalist Press and have evoked
                        disagreeable protests from Constantinople. Moreover, as we pointed out when
                        the telegraphic summary of the interview reached Egypt, His Highness was
                        discussing political matters with a Frenchman, and any laudatory allusions
                        to the part we had played here would have wounded the susceptibilities of a
                        large number of French people, who regard the abandonment of their country’s
                        historical claims in Egypt as a mortifying episode in their foreign
                        politics. Any such allusions would have at once been noticed by the French
                        Press, and such persons as Madame Adam, M. Flourens, and other Anglophobes
                        would have become far more furious at the Khedive for his sins of commission
                        than is the “Times” for his sins of omission. His Highness was between
                        Scylla and Charybdis, and he wisely chose the lesser of the two evils. Had
                        he adopted a tone designed to flatter England’s <cb n="6"/>just pride in her
                        work in Egypt, he would have not propitiated the “Times,” which accused him
                        a few weeks ago of supporting Mustapha Pasha Kamel’s recent journalistic
                        ventures, while his remarks might easily have been resented not only at
                        Yildiz Kiosk and on the Boulevards, but by a large section of his own
                        subjects. We have no doubt that the Viceroy in his heart of hearts is not
                        dissatisfied with a regime which has made him the richest man in Egypt, but
                        at the same time he would not be human if he did not long for the time to
                        come when he would be able to free himself from his political Mentors. After
                        all the Merovingian who is only too pleased to leave the management of his
                        realms to a masterful Mayor of the Palace is the most contemptible type of
                        potentate known to history.</p>
                    <p>The presumption underlying the “Times’s” criticism is the denial of the
                        Khedive’s right to have his own point of view. This is clear from the
                        critioism which the London newspaper passes on the last three words the
                        Khedive employed to the interviewer in his Highness’s message to the French
                        people. The “Times” appears to think that the Khedive ought to have been
                        thoroughly satisfied with the Anglo- French <hi rend="italic">entente</hi>
                        owing to the political results ensuing therefrom to Egypt. Surely this is a
                        most erroneous standpoint to assume. Up to that time the conflicting
                        jealousies of England and France in Egypt placed the Khedive in the happy
                        position of <hi rend="italic">Tertius gaudens</hi>. It was as much to his
                        Highness’s interest to see the two Powers maintaining their secular
                        antagonism as it had been Bismarok’s. It would doubtless be a good thing for
                        Ireland if the old hatred between the Orangemen and the Catholics were a
                        thing of the past and if both agreed to sink their political and religions
                        differences. If such an event had come to pass during the bitterest period
                        of the Gladstonian Home Rule agitation, the “Times” sentiments towards
                        Ulster would be very similar to the Khedive’s towards France as expressed in
                        his interview with M. Puaux. Both points of view are quite justifiable when
                        all the circumstances of the cases are taken into consideration.</p>
                    <p>There is little else to remark on in the interview. The Khedive says there is
                        no fanaticism in the country. We agree—that had ceased last September. His
                        Highness shows the sympathy for the national claims which we believe he
                        always has entertained, and he announces that he has no intention to follow
                        the prodigality of Ismail Pasha, which we can well believe. For the rest, we
                        have a homily on the duty of Princes, which might well have been modelled on
                        the injunctions contained in that <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> for
                        princely discourses, the eighteenth chapter of "II Principe.” “A Prince is
                        to have particular care that nothing falls from his mouth but what is full
                        of the five qualities of mildness, mercy, courtesy, religion and sincerity,
                        and that to see and hear him he appears all goodness, integrity, humanity,
                        and religion, which last he ought to pretend to more than ordinarily,
                        because more men do judge by the eye than by the touch. For everybody sees
                        how you appear, but few dare not oppose the opinion of the multitude, who
                        have the majesty of their prince to defend them. And in the actions of all
                        men, especially princes, where no man has power to judge every one looks to
                        the end. Let a prince, therefore, do what he can to preserve his life and
                        continue his supremacy, the means which he uses shall be thought honourable,
                        and be commended by everybody, because the people are always taken with the
                        appearance and event of things, and the greatest part of the world consists
                        of the people.” These counsels are followed in the carefully weighed words
                        his Highness employs in his declaration to the French journalist, and for a
                        strong-willed Prince, who has been placed in the delicate position of ruling
                        an unwarlike people and an important state with the assistance of a <hi
                            rend="italic">de facto</hi> sovereign and a <hi rend="italic">de
                            jure</hi> suzerain, there can be no more useful counsellor than the
                        Florentine political philosopher.</p>

                    <head>RENTS AT KHARTOUM.</head>
                    <p>Much concern is felt in Khartoum at the upward tendency in house rents. It is
                        now admitted that this state of things is the natural outcome of the present
                        economic conditions. The rise in the price of building sites as well as the
                        dearness of building materials have justified landlords in raising their
                        rents which, after all, are a poor return on the capital involved. This fact
                        should be always borne in mind when rents are considered. We hear that the
                        Government has estimated the rents of its houses inhabited by the officials
                        as 4% of the cost of building, the land being left out. Even then, we are
                        told, the better class of these houses will bring in as much as £E 100 to £E
                        120. Now a private landlord can do no less, if his money means anything to
                        him. And then the demand for houses has been so great that many people are
                        at a loss how to find a shelter within their means. Yet it is much cheaper
                        to pay a high rent than to build one’s own house.</p>
                    <p>This state of things has led many to believe that the present conditions
                        cannot prevail long. It is believed by these that the prices of land must
                        give way, but this does not seem probable and the relief, if any, must come
                        from another quarter.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that Khartoum is crowded. The increase in the number of
                        population exceeds the corresponding increase in the number of dwelling
                        places. It would be a different matter when bridges make Khartoum and
                        Omdurman one town. As building sites in the latter place are cheap and will
                        remain so for years it will be an easy matter for many residents in Khartoum
                        to live in the old town, coming over daily to Khartoum for their work, at a
                        small cost of money and time.</p>

                    <p>M. Georges Vayssié writes in the “Journal du Caire” :—</p>
                    <p>“The Divine Envoy, Father of the “Standards,” recently rose up and climbed
                        the minaret of the mosque of the Appeal to the peoples of Islam and there
                        muezzoned as follows : “Verily I say unto you. One more day and the ‘Journal
                        du Caire’ will be reduced to ashes and dust.” It is a good thing not to be
                        too impressionable, though the prospect of bring pulverised is always rather
                        unpleasant. In my expectation of this catastrophe I decided —weakly
                        enough—to take refuge in the desert. Sunday passed, Monday followed, and at
                        night-fall I decided to return furtively to Cairo and its journal, or at
                        least the smoking ruins of that organ of imposture. Oh miracle ! No
                        catastrophe! No firemen! Between Sunday and Wednesday the Prince of Egypt
                        and Bar-to-Bar had hurled nothing in my face but words.”</p>
                    <p>After rallying the Pasha on his attempts to explain away the articles
                        produced during his salad days—if not later—he compares the declarations of
                        the “Standards” and of “Al Lewa” and closes with the following interesting
                        letter written on April 22, 1906, to M. Bourgeois, Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs, by M. Jonuart, Governor-General of Algeria :</p>
                    <p>“It was in consequence of a violent campaign carried on against us by that
                        Egyptian (Moh. Bey Ferid) after a journey in French N. Africa and Europe, in
                        which he gave proofs of his hostility and bad faith, that the circulation of
                        ‘Al Lewa’ had to be forbidden on the proposal of my predecessor, by a decree
                        dated April 4, 1902. Since this foreign sheet continued to be frankly and
                        consistently hostile to us and we had to take into account the spirit
                        animating its director, Mustapha Pasha Kamel, as shown in the translations
                        which you were good enough to send me and in reports which I had received, I
                        recently decided that it was necessary for me to renew my instructions to
                        the competent authorities to carry out rigorously the decree interdicting
                        the circulation of ‘Al Lewa’ and to seize every copy of that paper the
                        instant it entered Algeria.”</p>

                    <p>The mail steamer Marmora, with T.R.H. the Duke and Duchess of Connaught on
                        board, dropped her anchor in the Suez Bay at 12.10 this afternoon. Their
                        Royal Highnesses were welcomed after free pratique was granted by Mr. D. A.
                        Cameron, C.B., H.B.M.’s Consul- General, Major-General Bullock, and his Aide

                        Captain of the Port, and Schalch Bey, Commandant of Suez Police.</p>
                    <p>Shortly afterwards, T.R.H. landed at the Suez Docks station, where they were
                        met by H.E. the Governor of Suez, Mr. A. Williams, Director of Customs, M.
                        De Tunis, Chief of Police, Macauley Bey, Mr. Schmidt, principal agent of the
                        Suez Canal Co, Mr. V. H Laferla, Pro-Consul at Suez, and others, when these
                        officials were introduced to the Duke by Mr. D. A. Cameron and Watson
                        Pasha.</p>
                    <p>The special train, which was waiting in readiness, steamed out of the station
                        shortly after, amidst the cheers of the spectators, and after a short
                        stoppage at the Suez station, left for Cairo at 2.10 p.m.</p>
                    <p>THE ARRIVAL IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>By 6.30 a native crowd had already begun to collect round about Cairo
                        station, a crowd consisting of the usual motley individuals who always have
                        time at their disposal. There were patient grey beards taking up their
                        positions on the steps, fellaheen and blue-robed porters passing hither and
                        thither, young Egyptians in every garb that personal taste dictated, short
                        coats over cotton galabiehs, long silken robes, or the smartest of Norfolk
                        suiting and narrow yellow boots, the crimson tarboosh topping each and every
                        one. Black-robed women, sore-eyed children, cheeky little bootblacks and
                        their brother wallads, and a hundred other units were there to force their
                        way to the front and to be pushed back into line by the energetic police. By
                        6 o’clock many others had arrived to meet the distinguished visitors,
                        carriages and motors were drawn up in line, and the Khedivial equipages with
                        their stalwart upstanding horses were in position. The light was slowly
                        fading from the sky, and the electric arcs were softly gleaning when the
                        escort of Lancers heralded the approach of H.H. the Khedive, and a few
                        minutes later, the cries of the sayces cleared the way for the carriage of
                        Lady Cromer. The crimson carpet on the steps was hastily flicked over for
                        the last time, the whistle of the approaching train was heard, a few belated
                        personages dashed to their places; and a few minutes after the appointed
                        time our royalties were making their adieux on the station steps and taking
                        their places in the carriages. Even in the fading light it was possible to
                        recognize the striking likeness of the Duke to our well-beloved sovereign;
                        and into most English minds there came that feeling of greatest satisfaction
                        that once again we were honoured by the presence of English Royalty among
                        us. An oriental crowd is nearly always silent and no expressions of
                        good-will or welcome were heard as carriage after carriage rolled away from
                        the station, and those containing the honoured visitors and Lady Cromer
                        bearing them swiftly to the Agency, that bearing H.H. the Khedive following
                        a few seconds later surrounded by his escort.</p>

                    <p>The following is a translation of the interview, the Khedive had with M. René
                        Puaux of "Le Temps,” about which so much discussion has raged in the English
                        and Egyptian Press:</p>
                    <p>Cairo, March 8.</p>
                    <p>I did not think a few years ago when at Divonne I met the Khedive, hiding his
                        incognito, at the little ville of Bothé, that I would have the honour of
                        seeing him again so soon amidst his own subjects. He had often invited me
                        thither when telling me about Egypt being the loveliest country in the
                        world, but nothing at that time led me to foresee the pleasant mission which
                        was to be entrusted to me.</p>
                    <p>"I said that you would come.” Such were the kind words, with which the
                        Khedive received me to-day on the threshold of his residence at Koubbeh,
                        where he lives in the winter. The day was a glorious one. The odours of the
                        spring-time rose from the garden. The almond trees are in flower. The birds
                        chirrup joyfully beneath the acacias in the aveuue and the Egyptian sky is
                        cloudless. Would that everyday life here were as calm as the climate, but
                        the excitement in Egypt arouses serious problems. The tactical errors of
                        English policy have given rise to a rather lively expression of discontent.
                        The abdication of the Khedive has even been mentioned, for he is tired of
                        seeing that his authority does not meet with recognition. His reserve and
                        the silence he has persisted in maintaining for many years past have given
                        grounds for all kinds of suppositions. But in my case he has revoked these
                        tactics and I am delighted to be in a position to publish here­with his
                        Highness’s declarations.</p>
                    <p>"The necessities of a peculiar political situation have forced me for a long
                        time past to refrain from the public expression of my opinions on my
                        countrys affairs. However, since you tell me that this silence is a source
                        of conjecture and error outside of Egypt, and since I am aware that even
                        here my reserve is interpreted in various ways, I will seize the
                        opportunity, which is offered me by the visit ofa friend, who is at the same
                        time an envoy in Egypt of “Le Temps” to make known my feelings and my
                        thoughts.”</p>
                    <p>‘I am passionately fond of my country, as every Egyptian, from the highest to
                        the lowest loves his native land. We are attached to our soil. It is ours,
                        our welfare and our devotion to it are inseparable. We cannot die far away
                        from Egypt. Egyptians do not emigrate. When away from their native land they
                        suffer from home sickness and they always come back to Egypt. I recall the
                        look of the poor fellahs whom I have met with in my travels. The deep pain
                        and the keen yearning to see again their hamlets in the Delta or in Upper
                        Egypt were so marked that the sight touched my heart. They have an
                        instinctive love of their own country, which takes the place of philosophy
                        and the science of history. These conservative folk are progressive. I have
                        followed their development day by day and have been struck by the great ease
                        with which they assimilate European culture. Whatever it be you show the
                        Egyptian, the, most complicated machine, the most perfect tools, he will at
                        once learn to use them. I have seen in my own works the most delicate
                        apparatus handled by Egyptians. The engineers, who showed me over, prided
                        themselves in pointing out to me that all their staff were natives. It had
                        been formed in a few weeks. This intelligence has been employed in the
                        development of modern civilisation in Egypt. The people have quickly adapted
                        themselves to their new conditions. They understand and profit by them. The
                        day is at hand when the Egyptian peasant with be on the same footing as the
                        people of the same class in the most progressive countries. The finances
                        have indeed come back to a firm state. We have got the confidence of Europe
                        to such a degree that Cairo and Alexandria are two of the most important
                        financial centres in the world. The international control of the Egyptian
                        debt is henceforth a thing of the past. It is now time to bring all our
                        efforts to bear not only towards the wellbeing of the population but towards
                        the satisfaction of their intellectual and moral wants. As far as I am
                        concerned I have no more serious preoccupation. It is quite wrong that it is
                        alleged that the national claims (revendications nationales) have taken an
                        anti-foreign and fanatic character I absolutely deny this charge. The
                        Egyptian people are naturally good. They are honest, hard-working and
                        tolerant. When they are treated gently and kindly they know how to reply.
                        Toleration is one of the great laws of our religion. The Koran enjoins on us
                        respect for all the prophets, whether they be Christians or Jews. We are all
                        deeply attached to our faith and faithful to its behests. I have travelled a
                        great deal and believe me, if everybody followed the moral precepts of their
                        religions as scrupulously as do the Moslems there would be less evil in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>“It has also been stated that I aspired to the re-establishment of my
                        personal power in order to wield it in the Eastern way and to take up with
                        the despotic and wasteful habits of my forerunners. To this charge I answer
                        that all my education was in Europe and it is there that I have learnt the
                        necessity of the co-operation of nation and ruler for the administration and
                        welfare of the country. Despotic power would be too heavy a task for my
                        shoulders. Furthermore if all my thoughts had only been directed towards my
                        personal satisfaction, the fifteen years of my reign would have simply been
                        one long unendurable agony. But I am conscious of having worked with all my
                        energy for the good of the country. It is that which has helped to keep up
                            my<cb n="6"/> courage in some difficult times. I have also kept myself
                        out of the question and have one and only one line of policy which is to
                        work in harmony with everybody for the welfare of the land. I have never
                        opposed measures I thought of utility to Egypt, I have never disdained
                        advice.”</p>
                    <p>The Khedive afterwards spoke to me about his work at Mariout, to which he has
                        devoted much time and trouble. He wants by advancing further and further the
                        railway towards the west and in developing Egyptian interests in the
                        direction of Tripoli to lend himself to a very important scheme, a line
                        across Africa to unite Tangiers and Cairo. I was aware of the Khedive’s
                        interest in this work. His Highness’s explanations proved to me that he is
                        always keenly interested in it. The results up to now are moreover
                        noteworthy and it will not be one of the least benefits of his reign. He is
                        very proud of it for it is all entirely due to his initiative.</p>
                    <p>When the Khedive was bringing my audience to an end, he hesitated
                        momentarily, and then concluded with a mournful little smile, “Tell the
                        French to come in numbers to Egypt. We do not forget what they have been for
                        us and we love them well <hi rend="italic">all the same</hi>."</p>

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN JUDGE. PRAISED BY TOLSTOI.</head>
                    <p>The many friends of the late Judge Crosby, formerly of the Mixed Courts at
                        Alexandria, will be interested to hear of a meeting, held on the 7th inst.
                        by many members of the Social Reform Club, of New York, in honor of his
                        memory.</p>
                    <p>Not only had men prominent in the world of art and science gathered there to
                        speak of the qualities of the man who once had resigned as judge of the
                        International Court, Alexandria, to follow Tolstoi, but others sent letters.
                        Among the letters read was one from Count Tolstoi, who said :</p>
                    <p>“ The death of Ernest Crosby is a very great sorrow for me. I realized the
                        strength of my inner spiritual connection with him only when I got the news
                        of his death.</p>
                    <p>“ It is a great and very rare happiness to possess such a friend, of whom one
                        can be sure that he understands you fully, and whose leading innermost force
                        of life is quite the same as your own. And excepting his greater
                        intelligence, talent and high morality, such a man was Ernest Crosby for
                        me."</p>
                    <p>Among the speakers was Edwin Markham, author of “ The Man with the Hoe, ” who
                        read an original poem entitled “ Crosby Called Back ” The last verse ran
                        :</p>
                    <p>Yea, now that your errand is ended,</p>
                    <p>And now that your steps go afar,</p>
                    <p>What strong soul will catch up the splendid, </p>
                    <p>High dream that your spirit attended—</p>
                    <p>The purpose of God for our star ?</p>
                    <p>Letters were read from William Dean Howells, W. J. Bryan, Tom L. Johnson,
                        William Lloyd Garrison and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Among the speakers
                        were the Rev. Leighton Williams, Hamlin Garland, Dr. Jane E. Robbins,
