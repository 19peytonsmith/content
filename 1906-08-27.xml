                        <head>BRITAIN'S FALLING BIRTH RATE</head>
                        <p>The continuous decline in the British birthrate is the most disquieting
                            sociological symptom of the present day, for the successive reports of
                            the Registrar-General mark the stages of a process as unbroken as it is
                            mysterious. The latest of these reports, dealing with the months April,
                            May, and June just past, is no exception to the general rule. It
                            announces a birthrate of 27.5 per thousand persons living, the lowest
                            ever recorded for the second quarter of the year. It is easy to mistake
                            the urgency of the problem thus presented. It has to be remembered that
                            to some extent the effects of the decreasing birth-rate are counteracted
                            by a decreasing death-rate. And it is practically beyond dispute that
                            the amount of this counteraction could be very much increased if the
                            nation made up its mind to prevent the preventable infant mortality
                            which is responsible for so large a proportion of the deaths recorded.
                            But whatever allowance be made for these considerations no allowance can
                            destroy the profound significance of the declining birth-rate. Thirty
                            years ago over thirty-six persons were born and nearly twenty-one died
                            annually for every thousand persons living; the difference of the two
                            rates or the net increase of the population was 15.4.Two years ago the
                            corresponding figures for birth and death were 27.9 and 16.2. The net
                            increase of the population was thus 11.7 per thousand. In other words,
                            the nation was in 1904 adding to its numbers at only three-quarters of
                            the rate at which it had been doing so in 1876. This,however, gives only
                            the results of a continuous process taken at two special points. It
                            fails to convey in any way the myste-terious character of the process
                            itself, as astonishing in its sudden beginning in year 1877 as in its
                            almost unbroken continuity. The slow upward movement of the birth-rate
                            before 1877 had been marked by violent fluctuations almost wholly absent
                            from the swifter movement of decline since that year. It is not easy to
                            avoid a feeling of helplessness in the face of this phenomenon. No one
                            can be certain what is going to happen; it is not easy to have or at
                            least to defend any positive opinion as to what ought to happen. Is
                            there any chance of the decline in the birth-rate being checked in the
                            near future, and giving place to a fresh upward movement? Will it on the
                            other hand continue, as its present course suggests, till, spite of all
                            diminution of the death-rate, the population in the United Kingdom
                            reaches the stationary stage familiar in France? If the decline reaches
                            that point, will it stop there? Is there, in fact, anything to guarantee
                            the nation against an actual decrease of numbers ? No one can really
                            answer any one of these questions definitely. Nor, except as to the last
                            possibility, which clearly indicates national decay,can any one really
                            say what would be the most desirable conclusion. For the present, no
                            doubt, there is abundant room for more people in Great Britain, or room
                            could and will be made by further industrial development. For the
                            present there is, and no doubt will be for some time to come, not simply
                            room for more people in the British Empire outside Great Britain, but a
                            vigorous demand for every efficient settler that can be spared. Most
                            Colonial birth-rates are declining as rapidly or more rapidly than those
                            of the Mother Country. In the comparatively near future we may perhaps
                            fairly expect a continuous increase of population, though at a falling
                            rate, and, having the waste spaces of the earth in mind, we may desire a
                            yet more rapid increase. But for a future more distant than fifty to
                            hundred years prophecy of what will happen is impossible; aspiration for
                            what should happen must depend upon the course of the birth-rate in
                            other nations and upon the progress of man’s control over nature. </p>

                            them and it was only with great difficulty that the brutes were
                            mastered. On arriving inside the police found a crowd of about 30
                            gamblers, both European and native. </p>

                        <p>SATURDAY'S CEREMONY</p>
                        <p> On Saturday the native population of Cairo was on holiday to celebrate
                            the ancient ceremony of the “cutting of the Khalig.” All the Ministries
                            and public offices were closed for the occasion, and native trade was
                            more or less at a standstill.</p>
                        <p>With the filling up of the Khalig and its conversion into a tramway road
                            the ceremony was shorn of most of its former glory, and nowadays it has
                            but a faint remblance to the festival which used to be held.</p>
                        <p>Early in the afternoon the Nile became crowded with craft of various
                            sizes, which collected in the vicinity of Kasr-el-Nil Bridge, and
                            shortly after three o’clock the gaily decorated Akaba passed, firing a
                            salute of twenty-one guns, with the cavalry band of the Egyptian Army on
                            board. All these vessels made their way towards the “fonm” of the
                            nonexistent Khalig, and for many hours they made short excursions to and
                            fro with delighted and noisy burdens of humanity.</p>
                        <p>It was not until nine o’clock, however, that the reception was held by
                            H.E. Mahmoud Pasha Sidky, representing his Highness the Khedive, and at
                            that hour the scene was very animated and did not lack picturesqueness.
                            Several large marquees had been erected on both sides of the old Foum el
                            Khalig, and these, brilliantly illuminated, were crowded with natives,
                            among whom mingled officers of the Egyptian Army and the Army of
                            Occupation, English Government officials and many civilians.</p>
                        <p>The river presented a very pretty scene with the numerous boats passing
                            op and down, lanterns with glasses of various hues hanging from the
                            riggings and decks of the larger dahabiehs. About half-past Dine the
                            firework display commenced and for some time one was deafened by the
                            banging of squibs and similar pieces, mixed with the hissing of rockets
                            and catherine wheels. The fireworks included many “set pieces” of
                            different designs, and though one was at times rather fearful of the
                            rocket sticks—for the rockets were fired off with an absolute disregard
                            of direction,—the sight was excellent and enjoyable.</p>
                        <p>Shortly before ten o’clock the Governor of Cairo left the scene,
                            accompanied by a mounted bodyguard and was again saluted by the fitting
                            of 19 guns. Most of those who had been invited to the reception left
                            immediately after the departure of Mahmoud Pasha Sidky, though the
                            fireworks continued for some time, and as we drove away we were almost
                            choked by the sulphurous fumes.</p>

                            Cairo, will return from Europe with his family on the 10th proxo. The
                            Count has an American wife in the person of the daughter of Edward
                            Luckemyer, of New York. His successor at the Court of St. James’s, young
                            Baron Von Stumm, has an American mother in the person of the daughter of
                            Louis Von Hoffman, the New York banker. Baron Max von Oppenheim will
                            return to Cairo to resume his official duties at the German Agency
                            towards the end of October. “Les Pyramides,” in commenting on the false
                            rumour as to the Baron’s transfer from Egypt, remarks :— Il serait, on

                            natives and foreigners are as friendly as they were before. All are
                            contented with each other.That no mischievous fanaticism exists at all
                            in Egypt, is proved by the tranquillity which exists throughout the

                        <p>A Cairo morning newspaper in its issue of yesterday published the
                            following paragraph, under the above heading : — “On Thursday last,
                            which is a day celebrated by the Moslems in commemoration of their dead,
                            a large crowd of Mohamedan women were assembled at the cemetery near
                            Pompey’s Pillar for the purpose, when thirty children separated
                            themselves from the crowd and disappeared and they could not be found up
                            to yesterday despite all efforts made to trace them.” The Alexandria

                            projected to a distance, and both were found terribly injured and
                            unconscious. D’Arangeon was carried into a house at Thiberville, where
                            he died within an hour. Prince Mohamed Ibrahim was taken to the Bernay
                            Hospital, where the doctors decided that a trepanning operation should
                            take place when the Prince had rallied a little. The departmental legal
                            officials held an inquiry at Bernay after the accident, and have
                            attributed it to the excessive speed at which the motor-car was
                            driven.</p>
                        <p>Prince Mohamed-Ibrahim was staying at Deauville, and on Friday, after
                            having played in a polo match, he went tor the fateful drive. The Prince
                            lived in the Rue de la Faisauderie, near the Bois de Boulogne, in a
                            house formerly occupied by a military attache of the British Embassy. He
                            gave orders six months ago for the construction of a splendid house in
                            the Avenue Kleber, near that of his father-in-law, Prince Ibrahim Hilmi.
                            This place is expected to be ready for occupation towards the end of the
                            present year. The Prince was fond of all sorts of sport, and for some
                            time past had taken up motoring with great assiduity, frequently going
                            on long excursions with the Princess all over the Continent He left,
                            with his family, for Deauville on August 1, having hired there the Villa
                            Coutant and the fine grounds attached.</p>
                        <p>Soon after the Prince was settled at the villa, his chauffeur,
                            D’Arangeon, went down there with a newly-purchased 60 horse power
                            motor-car. D’Arangeon had been in the Prince’s employ for nearly two
                            years, and had gone over Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Germany without a
                            hitch. He was a careful driver, and his colleagues in Paris say that he
                            is possibly a victim to obedience, as he had to leave his master to
                            drive, and most of the accidents occur in that way. The chauffeur, it is
                            said, was constantly told by the Princess not to allow her husband to
                            drive, as the Prince lost his coolness when in charge.</p>
                        <p>The Princess—who,with her children, was at Deauville—delayed dinner on
                            Friday night owing to her husband’s absence. Later on, fearing the
                            worst, she had the adjoining country searched throughout the night She
                            only heard the fatal news on Saturday afternoon from Paris. The
                            explanation of this is that when the Prince was conveyed to the Bernay
                            Hospital unconscious, no papers giving his Deauville address were found
                            on him. The Paris address, Rue de la Faisanderie, was, however,
                            discovered on a letter, and a telegram announcing the accident was sent
                            there from the hospital.</p>
                        <p>Another account says:--</p>
                        <p>The original accounts of this most terrible of autocar accidents were
                            sadly lacking in some essential details. It is now known that the mishap
                            occurred shortly after seven o’clock on Friday evening. The chauffeur
                            was driving at a rapid rate, and hoped to shoot over the level crossing
                            between Bernay and Cormeilles before the arrival of a train. He saw the
                            train, but went on and the autocar, caught by the engine, was smashed
                            up. The people in the train shrieked with terror as they beheld the
                            collision and saw the two men in the motor car projected along the
                            railway. The train was stopped, and the driver and the stoker got off
                            the engine and went to assist the sufferers. D’Arangeon, the Prince’s
                            chauffeur, was delirious. His chest was smashed and his legs and arms
                            broken. The Prince, unconscious, had a fractured skull, and his ribs and
                            left arm were broken. Some of the passengers in the train, which was
                            standing on the line, left their carriages and ran on to Thiberville for
                            doctors and stretchers for the injured men. The chauffeur was carried to
                            a farmhouse, where he was attended to, bnt he died within an honr. The
                            Prince was conveyed to the Bernay Hospital, where he underwent
                            trepanning, but passed away after it. He had not only been injured in
                            the head, but in the lower part of the body, and his condition from the
                            first was hopeless.</p>

                        <p>GERMAN COMPETITION.</p>
                        <p>The article in the Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt re
                            German trade here has aroused great interest in England. Commenting on
                            the article in question, "Commercial Intelligence” of last week mentions
                            a rumour that the shipping companies trading between the Continent and
                            the Mediterranean and Black Sea ports have also arrived at a "mutual
                            understanding,” but this point requires confirmation. Supplementing the
                            Board of Trade’s extracts, "Commercial Intelligence” adds, on the
                            subject of direct dealing, that the Englishman argues—and with some show
                            of reason—that it is better to sell to a well known home merchant than
                            to run the risk of making had debts through an agent in Egypt. This
                            handicaps the British goods by their having to pay an intermediate
                            profit before being placed on the Egyptian market. The German saves this
                            profit, and though he may make certain bad debts, he trusts to recoup
                            himself by means of a larger turnover. In reference to trade credits,
                            the aim of the German is to get into the country, but the result of the
                            lavish credit is that German failures are largely on the increase.</p>

                        <head>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</head>
                        <p>We do not hold ourselves responsible for the opinions expressed by our
                            correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play to all, to
                            permit—within certain necessary limits —free discussion.</p>
                        <p>EGYPTIAN LAND AND GENERAL TRUST.</p>
                        <p>To the Editor of the "EGyptian Gazette.” Dear Sir,—The published account
                            of the general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Land &amp; Investment Co.,
                            Ltd., must afford us food for somewhat painful reflection, and, though
                            it is useless to cry over spilt milk, it may be useful to point out what
                            we have lost when enquiring what we are to get in lien thereof.</p>
                        <p>At the moment of writing I have before me the following reply to an
                            enquiry made this morning. It speaks for itself:</p>
                        <p>“Deltas are quoted <unclear>3(1/2)-(3/4)</unclear> there are no sellers. Trusts quoted 1/16
                            discount to par <hi rend="italics">with no business in them.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>From the speech of the chairman of the Delta Land Co. it is evident that
                            we should not have received the dividend of one shilling a share which
                            the proposed amalgamation agreement provided for if any dividend were
                            paid to the Delta shareholders, but we should have been the better off
                            without it for we should have ranked equally with them in the
                            distribution of accrued profits, and as they have made over £50,000 in
                            the first three months of the year, it looks as if we should have shared
                            in a handsome dividend at the end of the current year or perhaps sooner.
                            We were deprived of the advantages of amalgamation, in my opinion,
                            without sufficient cause and by the decision of a small meeting in
                            London, and the question now is, What is going to be done for us by way
                            of compensation ?</p>
                        <p>In a recent issue of your paper, M.M. de Vries and Boutigny stated in
                            their circular that the amalgamation having .fallen through, rumour said
                            that either our capital was to be reduced or the company to be wound up.
                            I have farther received a circular from our head office that a meeting
                            will shortly be called to consider the accounts to the 80th June last
                            and proposals for the future.</p>
                        <p>What our accounts should show is that we owe to the bank a sum of
                                <unclear>£55,000</unclear>, unless they be closed at a date previous
                            to this debt having been incurred and, with this hanging over our heads,
                            it is useless to consider reduction of capital. Any such reduction,
                            however, would merely free us from our fear of being called upon for
                            more money and it would in no way improve our prospects in regard to
                            what we have already paid.</p>
                        <p>The only thing left to us is to liquidate. Our properties are good enough
                            and quite possibly we might at once get back our money, but, if we
                            continue simply watching them at a cost of some £3,000 a year, with the
                            chance of a reaction in values coming upon us, we may find ourselves in
                            for a very different kind of settlement I have had no previous
                            experience of a company where direction has been so variable and
                            management so wanting, and to this only can I attribute the fact that
                            our present position is what it is. It is high time for shareholders to
                            take action and there is no time to lose. The best thing is to liquidate
                            and to place the matter in independent and strong hands. The
                            alternatives are to effect a complete change or to see whether the Delta
                            Lands will again listen to us.—I am, etc.,</p>

                        <p>THE DATE PALM SCALE.</p>
                        <p>A new and very interesting species, the first African representative of
                            the genus Sphaero coccus, has been discovered by Mr. Walter Draper,
                            F.L.S., who for the last ten years has been in charge of the Government
                            Gardens, Delta Barrage, near Cairo. This new species of scale insect,
                            which is extremely common on date palms in Egypt, occurs in the form of
                            white patches on the base of the leaf-stalks immediately below the head
                            of the palm. It has received the name Sphaerococcus Draperi,
                            Newstead.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Robert Newstead, the expert on Coccidae at the Liverpool University,
                            to whom specimens were sent for identification, states that “the female
                            of the new species is distinguished chiefly by the minute rudimentary
                            antennea the entire absence of legs, and the character of the waxlike
                            covering. The larva is also characterized by the antenna which has the
                            first segment unusually broad. There are also other minute
                            differences."</p>
                        <p>The diagnostic characters of the genus are: Adult females, naked or
                            producing cotton or wax ; anal tubercles absent ; anal orifice without
                            hairs; antennae usually of less than seven joints, but sometimes
                            atrophied ; legs present, atrophied or deformed.</p>
                        <p>Eighteen species are recorded from Australia, nearly all of which inhabit
                            galls on various species of eucalyptus, etc. ; two are described from
                            the United States of America, one from Japan, and the newly-discovered
                            one in Egypt, which has been dedicated to the discoverer, makes a total
                            of twenty-one species.</p>
                        <p>We understand that Mr. Draper, who has had some considerable experience
                            with scale and other insect peats in Egypt, is about to publish a small
                            work on Egyptian coccids. </p>

                            transferred to the Saidieh Secondary School, starts his career in Egypt
                            with an excellent record. After leaving Rugby, where he was head boy of
                            the school, he entered King’s College, Cambridge, as an open classical
                            scholar in 1888. From Cambridge, where he obtained a First Class in the
                            Classical Tripos, he went as assistant-master to Bedford Grammar School.
                            There he remained till 1903, when he was appointed headmaster of
                            Richmond School, Yorkshire, which position he has occupied up to the
                            present Experience of the kind such as Mr. Furness has enjoyed should be
                            found most useful to him in his new position, and we consider the
