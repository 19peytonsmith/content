The man had embarked at Algiers and appeared to be in full possession of his senses. When his corpse was discovered yesterday morning, the revolver was clutched in his hand and it was impossible to remove it. He wrote five letters before doing away with himself, one being to his mother, one to his brother, one to the captain of the vessel one to the French Consul, and the other to the Police Commandant. He was found to have £70 in his possession. His body was handed over to the French consular authorities for interment.</p>
                <p>An Example for Alexandria.—Nothing is ever heard now about the Alexandria Tenants Commission, and the scheme for housing European artizans in model dwellings appears to have been forgotten. Meanwhile an instruc tive example of what can be done comes from Lyons. The Lyons Savings Bank has built in certain overcrowded and insanitary industrial districts in the department of the RhOne a number of model workmen’s dwellings. The houses are of two storeys, with a small garden, and let at from twelve to seventeen francs per month. Every modern improvement has been applied  in their construction. Very little timber has been used, and the boarded floors are covered with linoleum. Every dwelling was let as soon as it was ready for occupation, and it is intended to continue the experiment on a larger scale.</p>

                <head>HIS RECEPTION IN LONDON.</head>             
                <p>London, June 18.
                The Khedive who. will be among the guests at the Royal wedding, arrived in London last evening, having crossed from Calais to Dover in the afternoon, and travelled to Victoria Station by special South-Eastern and Chatham train, which reached the terminus at a quarter-past seven o’clook. The train was ran into the departure side of the station, so that the Royal Waiting Room and Wilton-road exist were available for the Khedive and the distinguished company assembled to receive him. A portion of the platform was reserved and carpeted. Among those awaiting his Highness were the Duke of Connaught, Prince Arthur of Connaught, General Sir Godfrey Clerk, attached on behalf of King Edward ; Sir Eldon Gorst, Principal Under Secretary at the Foreign Office; Sir Eric Barrington, Principal Private Secretary to Lord Lansdowne; the Swedish Minister in London and the personnel of the Swedish Legation ; Count Stenbock, Sir Rennell Rodd, Lady Garvagh, the Hon. Leopold Canning, Mr. Bax-Ironside and Mrs. Bax-Ironside ; Colonel Egerton and Major Murray, in attendance on the Duke of Connaught; Captain Walter Campbell, Groom-in-Waiting to the King ; and Captain Yarde-Buller, attached on behalf on the King. The Khedive was most cordially greeted by the Duke of Connaught, who presented in turn Prince Arthur, Sir Godfrey Clerk, Captain Yarde-Buller, Colonel Egerton, Major Murray, Sir Eldon. Gorst, Sir Eric Barrington, Sir Rennell Rodd, and others, with all of whom his Highness shook hands heartily. He in turn presented the principal members of his suite, and afterwards, attended by Sir Godfrey Clerk and Captain Yarde-Boller, drove to Claridge’s Hotel. By order of the King, Royal carriages were sent from Buckingham Palace for the use of his Highness and suite. The Khedive will leave Paddington for Windsor Castle at twenty minutes past twelve o’clock today on a visit to the King and Queen, and will remain until after the wedding.</p>
                <p>Describing the arrival of Prince Gustavus Adolphus at Victoria station, on Monday last, the London correspondent of the “New York Herald” (Paris) says :—Just before the Prince came the Khedive of Egypt had arrived at Victoria from Paris. The Duke of Connaught and Prince Arthur had received him also, and seen him off to Claridge’s Hotel, whence he will go down to Windsor to-day. The short, square figure of Egypt’s ruler, in a top-hat and frock coat, was hardly recognised by the crowd, but everyone is talking of his gift to the bride, the high diamond tiara with its design of marguerites , which is one of Princess Margaret's most magnificent presents.	 </p>
                <p>The Khedive’s present to the Princess Margaret of Connaught on the occasion of her marriage was a high diamond tiara, convertible into a necklace, in a conventional design of marguerites.</p>
                <p>Our Constantinople Correspondent states that during his sojourn at Vienna the Khedive received the visit of H. R. H. the Prince of Montenegro. The Prince remained with his Highness for one hour.</p>

                <p>The Alexandria Municipality does not intend to sell the new quay and other estates until next October, when, it is hoped, all the local capitalists will have returned from Europe.</p>
                <p>No arrangements as to the order of the sales have yet been made. Altogether, without counting the roads, the total superficies of land to be disposed of by the Municipality is 150,000 square metres. But of this the Egyptian Government has taken a certain quantity as compensation for the present site of the Alexandria Gouvernorat, the Pallone barracks, etc. Then sites are to be taken over by the Alexandria Municipality to afford access to the quay. No decision has as yet been arrived at as to the date when these important works are to be undertaken.</p>
                <p>The summer habitation of the Egyptian Government will in future be no longer at the San Stefano Hotel-Casino, as the Ministerial offices are to be housed on the new
                quay.</p>
                <p>The Alexandria Municipal buildings will remain on their existing site, as there are no funds available for building an edifice on the new quay.</p>

                <p>A serious affray is stated to have taken place yesterday in the Moharrem Bey quarter of Alexandria between Greeks and Arabs, and at one time the disturbance threatened to assume serious dimensions. The Alexandria police refuse to give any details to the Press, and on enquiry this morning at the Moharrem Bey caracol all official information was categorically refused. It is stated that blood flowed freely, and that the dispute originated an altercation between a Greek and a cabman. The cabman was assisted by many natives and the quarrel became general. Many Europeans were insulted. As no official information is vouchsafed, we must hold over full details until tomorrow’s issue.</p>

                <p>All who were present at the services yesterday would much appreciate the efforts put forth by the members of the choir to make the choral part of the services a real help to the congregation. Tours’ Te Deum was well sung, and Bunnett’s well-known setting for the Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis was joined in heartily by the congregation. The words of the anthem were taken from Isaiah LXV. 17, 18, Revelation XXI. 1, 2, set to music by A. R. Gaul as an air and choral sanctus in the “Holy City.” The solo was taken by Mr. W. F. Sarjeant, who sang the beautiful words with much feeling ; every word could be heard distinctly throughout the church. The chorus, which was the Ter Sanctus, was sung by the whole choir very effectively with care and reverence.</p>

                <p>The Nile valley has experienced remarkable climatic changes since the completion by the British of the great irrigation system, and there have been electrical storms of a character hitherto unknown to the country, daring one of which the Khephren pyramid was struck by lightning, an occurrence that has never before been recorded.</p>
                <p> Aside from its meteorological importance, the event is of particular interest to Philadelphians, as it may result in the complete equipping of the pyramids with lightning rods made in this city. Inquiries are now being made by J. C. Hendrique, who is semi-officially attached to the Egyptian service, about the price and construction of lightning rods turned out by local manufacturers.</p>
                <p> A lightning rod system for the pyramids would be a pretty big undertaking but eventually it may turn out that the ancient piles will bear superimposed devices bearing the trademark, “Made in Philadelphia.” — “Philadelphia Record.”</p>

                <head> EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND. </head>
                <p>The “Manchester Guardian,” in commenting on the fact that the Egypt Exploration Fund is still very short of money, and has not yet quite recovered from the depression of a few years ago, remarks : “This is very unfortunate at a moment when every other nation is striving its utmost to ransack Egypt for treasures. England is nominally in occupation of Egypt, but her position there in regard to antiquities is highly unsatisfactory. The Anglo-French Agreement has handed over the Antiquities Department to the control of the French, and there are not likely to be many Englishmen left in that department a few years hence. We have still some very active diggers, but the prizes are going to other races. Dr. Reissner is digging up the Pyramids’ plateau for the Californians, the Italians are at work in the Valley of the Queens, the latest tomb in the Valley of the Kings was dug out by an American, the Germans have built a new house, blessed by the Emperor, close to Thebes and only the English researches lag for want of funds. It is an old cry. </p>

                The British steamer “Foyle,” from Rangoon, bound, I understand, for Alexandria with a full cargo of rice, is reported to be badly ashore south of the Hanish Island in the Red Sea.</p>

                <p>The P. and O. steamer “Isis,” which arrived at Port Said last Wednesday, collided with a Turkish sailing vessel when eight miles out from Brindisi. The Turkish ship was sunk, five of her crew being drowned.</p>

                <p>Our Port Said Correspondent writes:— Your readers will remember the sinking of the Canal Company’s new sucking dredger over two months ago owing to the culpable negligence of her crew in leaving her ports and scuttles open. Preliminary operations for refloating her have at last been started. A dredger has commenced dredging close to her side in such a manner that she will soon fall upright, after which she is to be lifted with the aid of lighters.</p>

                <p>Our Constantinople Correspondent states in regard to the new line between Alexandria and Constantinople, which the Roumanian steamship company intends to start, that the company has ordered for this service a new steamer from the Loire chantiers, which will be named “Emperor Trajan.” It will be of the same type as the “Romania.”</p>

                <head>PROVINCIAL WATER SUPPLY.</head>
                <p>The installation of potable water at Man-sourah has been completed at a cost of L.E. 20,000, and the water has been supplied to the inhabitants of that town through the last improved Jewell filter since Wednesday last. Meanwhile, work is being actively carried on for a similar installation at Damietta, and the Ministry of the Interior has decided to make installations of pure water in all the principal bandars as far as possible. It is hoped that in two years’ time pare water may be supplied to all the villages.</p>
                <p>The Government has appointed an expert, M. Abel, to advise in all matters connected with the water supply of towns. We need not emphasise the great importance of this reform from the sanitary point of view. The prevalence of typhoid fever among Europeans and of gastro enteritis among the children of the Arab population is caused in part by impure water, and we congratulate the authorities on their determination to ensure a good supply of water for all our provincial towns.</p>

                <p>Dolce Far Niente.—The heat has commenced and everyone is holiday-making. Children and parents are abandoning themselves to some months of delicious freedom from work. However, the brain most always be employed ; if not, the mind soon loses its accustomed vigour. Practical people therefore increase their literary collections and perfect themselves in some foreign language, or learn a new one at the Berlitz School at Cairo, 1, Sharia Hamel, or at the Alexandria school 26, Rue de l'Eglise Copte. It is a very profitable distraction. [Advt]</p>

                <head>BURGLARY AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                <head>CAFFARI’S STORES FORCED OPEN.</head>
                <p>The premises of Mr. J. B. Caffari, the Army contractor, forwarding agent, etc, in Ramleh-boulevard and at the corner of rue de l’Eglise Debbane, were burgled last night. The thieves entered the premises by breaking through the double doors of the office. They prised open the safe and emptied it of its contents. It is believed that the safe contained over £100 in gold and small change. The robbers also made away with a Credit Fonoier lottery bond from the safe (No. 887,701), and a large quantity of silver plate, etc., from the shop. No suspicion attaches to anybody.</p>
                <p>It is strange that the thieves effected their entry and exit without observation, as there are passers-by at all times of the night, and the situation of the premises is very prominent. Mr. Caffari also pays the Alexandria Gouvernorat for the services of a ghaffir, who is supposed to be on duty all night!</p>

                <p>The work of exploration in Northern Khargeh progresses most satisfactorily. The exploring party has located several extensive sub-terranean water conduits connected by lines of manholes conveying water over a large area, besides other remains of irrigation works, among them a stone-faced well 10 feet in diameter giving so copious a supply of water that the means at the command of the exploring party did not permit them to clear it beyond 15 feet Trial surface wells have been sunk starting from Ain el Ghazal at Ain Karam Mohamed (where no well (has existed for many years), Kasr Gip, and two other intermediate places. Copious water supplies have been found everywhere at depths never exceeding fifteen feet, while in many places the water which is apparently percolating from the ancient irrigation channels is only one or two feet below the surface. The soil is of the very finest quality and has been highly cultivated in Roman times. The area over which the water supply is thus proved (up to the present) is about 10 square miles. Gardening operations and cultivation at the Deir and No. 1 borehole are progressing satisfactorily, and the chemist to the corporation has now completed the preparation of bulk samples of alums, etc., for despatch to England.</p>

                 <head>ANCIENT EGYPTIAN GARB RESUSCITATED.</head>
                <p>The “Philadelphia Press” remarks : With a desire to indulge in singular effects in costumes and house furnishings, so many women have gone to the Japanese for the styles that the term “singular” no longer applies. Japanese rooms in New York houses and Jap robes for indoor wear have become common. But Mrs. Clarence Mackay has gone in a different geographical direction for a suggestion for a gown. She has designed a costume that might have been worn by a daughter of one of the Pharaohs. Its colors are brown and white and it is embroidered heavily with silver. The skirt is doable. The under one is of brown chiffon, worked in a design often seen in Egyptian decorations and finished with a band of white cloth. The overskirt is of heavy lace. The bodice also is of lace with embroidered shoulder straps. The sleeves are tull and flowing. With this costume Mrs. Mackay wears a necklace of carnelians in quaint settings.</p>
