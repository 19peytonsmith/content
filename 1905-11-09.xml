                        <p>St. Petebsburg, November 8. An official communique says that it is not to
                            be denied that, in some places, the local anthori- ties are hostile to
                            the reforms and have encouraged the recent excesses. A judicial enquiry
                            has been ordered in all the localities where it is suspected that such
                            has been the case. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>St. Petersburg, November 8. Despite the general cessation of strikes, the
                            Railway Union has issued a significant circular to the railway men
                            saying that they must store their arms, and when the decisive mo- ment
                            comes rise as one man, and never lay them down until a complete victory
                            be won. The details of the horrors of the past ten days are gradually
                            leaking out. They surpass imagination. In one instance, at Minsk,
                            several detachments of troops poured a cross-fire into an unarmed crowd,
                            killing and wounding 400 in a few moments. It appears that 50,000 troops
                            with guns were landed by the warships at Helsingfors on the 3rd instaht.
                            The situation became most critical, when the Imperial manifesto arrived
                            and relieved the tension. (Reuter)</p>

                            and the occasion of the 64th birthday of King Edward VII. drew large
                            numbers of sightseers to this morning's review on Abdeen-sqaaro, Cairo,
                            and though, as a spectacle, the sight was perhaps not as impressive as
                            in 1904, owing to the reduction of the Army of Occupation, there was
                            still any amount of oolour and life in the scene, and the troops bore
                            themselves admirably. Comparisons are of course odious, and we have no
                            intention of attempting them. We need only say that the parade movements
                            were very good, the marching, dressing, wheeling, etc., being
                            excellently carried out, and that the physique of the men was admirable.

                            and which often appear to be composed of weedy boys. The police were in
                            readiness before 9 a.m., and the square, which had been cleared of
                            vehicles and loiterers, awaited the coming of tbe troops. At the
                            entrances of the streets leading to the square, except those that had
                            been kept free for the troops to enter and to leave by, large crowds
                            gathered betimes, and the enclosures filled up rapidly. By a
                            quarter-past nine all the troops had moved into the square and taken up
                            their posi- tions, facing westward, the Rifles being on the left nearest
                            the Palace, the Inniakillings next, and the Royal Engineers, Mounted
                            Infantry, and Royal Garrison Artillery on the right. At 9.80 Lord Cromer
                            drove up, the troops saluting to the strains of "God save the King,”
                            while the Royal Standard was hoisted. The British Consul-General, after
                            a short oonversa tion with Brig-General Bullock, then drove along tbe
                            rank, the troops presenting arms as he passed. H.H. the Khedive
                            afterwards arrived, escort- ed by his Body Gaard, and mounted on a
                            magnificent white Arab, tire bands playing the Khedivial Anthem as his
                            Highneea took up his position close to the Royal Stan- dard. A general
                            salute followed, the national anthem being played again, and the troops
                            gave three cheers for H.M. the King with great heartiness, to the
                            accompaniment of the guns in the CitadeL The troops then marched past,
                            H.H. the Khedive taking the salute, after which came the interesting

                            repairing in rivers or harbors. It was in the direct route of steamers
                            bound from Cape Matapan to Cape Pasoaro. The Aoreole took the pontoon in
                            tow with three 7in. hawsers. For a time some of the sailors remained
                            aboard the deraliot to bale out the water, but it labored so heavily in
                            tbe heavy seas that they were obliged to come on board tbeir own vessel.
                            The pontoon crane which was worth £l 5,000, was bound for Port Said, but

                            the theft was done to the temptations put in the way of the workmen by
                            the dealers in antiquities, who offer the men very high prices. At

                            this season have now reached 35,596 bales, a number behind the record of
                            1904. Tbe im- portations from Egypt show an increase over this
                            corresponding period of last year of about 3,000 bales.</p>

                        <p>A correspondent writes:- Some annoyance has recently been caused at Cairo
                            by the increases of that annoying class of bicyclists which prefers the
                            pavement to tbe road. Out at Gherireh, or beyond Shocbra and Abbasaieb,
                            there is, no doubt, less to be urged against tbe habit, but it is no
                            joke to walk on the pavements of, say, Suleiman Pasha-street, or the
                            streets leading toward tbe Ministries, if one is constantly called upon
                            to get ont of the way by the bells of youthful bicyclists, many of whom
                            seem to steer so badly that one easily understands why they avoid the
                            neighbourhood of the arabiyas. Of course, if one refuses to move the
                            cyclists must avoid the pedestrian, bnt he often steers so badly that it
                            is better to run no risks.</p>

                        <head>(From oub Correspondent.)</head>
                        <p>Suakin, November 1. Washouts have taken place on the Suakin- Athars line,
                            and serious damage has resulted in several places. Trains stopped
                            running from both ends between the 95th and 98th Ootober, when tbe line
                            was repaired and put in good order. Kaimakam Loogfield Bey, E.E.,
                            Asaristant Director of Railways, left hereby special train on the night
                            of the 98th ult on inspection duty and returned on the 80th, -after
                            having found everything in perfect working order. Mr. Thomas Purvis,
                            Suakin-Atbara Railway, returned from leave of absence by the Khedi- vial
                            mari steamer Neghileh on 80th nit, bringing with him Mrs. Purvis and
                            child. Dr. Crispin, S.M.O., Buskin Mondirieh, is leaving for Port Sudan.
                            He will organise the Mondirieb medical staff and hospital then. Dr.
                            Pahmy win remain here as S.M.O. in charge of the hospitals and the
                            Suakin railway employee. Among the signs of the development of the
                            Sudan, and the benefits resulting from the opening of the new port, I
                            may mention the fact that Messrs. Loremato Bros., a large firm of
                            merchants, who have branches at almost every port in the Red Sea, have
                            already established themselves af Port Sedan. Both there and at Buskin,
                            they are largely patronised by English people. Their goods come chiefly
                            from England and are in price. Mr. George Lorenxtato is the general
                            manager, and all orders pass through his hands and receive his personal
                            attention.</p>

                        <head>MYSORE CO. AND EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>In the report of tbe Mysore Reefs and General Exploration Company for the
                            year ended September 30, the directors propose another reconstruction.
                            Tbe present company was formed as recently as July, 1909, as a
                            reconstruction of tbe Mysore Reefs (Kangundy) Mining Company, but the
                            directors now explain that a large proportion of the capital is repre-
                            sented in the balance sheet by the property originally worked in India,
                            upon which opera- tions have been suspended, and they considsr that the
                            time has arrrived when this unproduc- tive expenditure should be dealt
                            with. They, therefore, propose to form "The Mysore Reefs and General
                            Explorers, limited," to take over the assets and liabilities of the
                            present company. The capital of the new company would be £50,000,
                            divided into 40,000 Preference and 160,000 Ordinary Shares of 6s each
                            thus providing for the allotment of one fully-paid Ordinary Share for
                            each old Ordinary Shan, and one fully-paid Preference Share for each old
                            Preference Share. Tbe existing shares are £l fully paid, and the
                            proposal is thus to write down the capital account by 76 per dent The
                            report shows a balance of profit for the year at £1,673.</p>
