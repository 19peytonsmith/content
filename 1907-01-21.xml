                    <p>OUR NATIONAL PROSPERITY.</p>
                    <p>The figures of our foreign trade for the year, and of our rrevenue for the
                        nine months ending on December 31 enable us to form some estimate of our
                        national prosperity. They are, says the "Spectator," sufficient remarkable
                        to startle even the most optimistic. </p>
                    <p>For the first time in our history the total volume of oar foreign trade
                        largely, exceeds the enormous figure of one thousand million sterling.
                        Imports have increased by 7.6 per -cent., exports by 13.9 per cent., and the
                        reexport trade by 9.5 per cent To give the figures : — The total value of
                        imports was £607,998,000, an increase of £42,968,000 over those of the
                        preceding-year ; exports reached £375,673,000, an increase of £45,856,000;
                        while re-exports were £85,163,000, an increase of £7,383,000. The details,
                        are as satisfactory as the totals. Among the imports, it is raw material and
                        articles mainly or wholly manufactured in which the chief increase lies, the
                        advance being over 12 per cent. Among the exports, the growing items are
                        largely articles wholly or mainly manufactured, the increase being 13.5 per
                        cent. To take one item, the increase in the export of iron and steel is 25
                        per cent in value and 26 per cent in quantity.</p>
                    <p>Nor has the first impression made by these  Returns to be corrected by much
                        writing down on account of increased prices. It is true that the prices of
                        many articles and commodities were higher last year than the year before but
                        the general rise in prices is estimated at only 6 per cent, which leaves an
                        ample, margin for quantitative increase. Many conclusions may be drawn from
                        these figures, but one is insistent We are experiencing an unexampled ware
                        of prosperity. Free-trader and Tariff Reformer alike can make but the one
                        deduction. The increase in the imports of raw material and partially
                        manufactured goods, and in the export of wholly or partially manufactured
                        goods, shews that during the past year there has been a high pressure laid
                        upon our producing activity. The demand has forced an expansion of supply.
                        The Tariff Reformer may argue, as the "Times" does, that the dumping of iron
                        has ceased because America is too prosperous and is unable to supply her own
                        requirements, or that we are relieved of some Continental competition
                        because trade is so good with our neighbeurs.The “Spectator” prefers to put
                        it that a general wave of prosperity is passing over the world, and that our
                        existing economic system enables us to take full advantage of it.</p>
                    <p>The Revenue Returns for the last nine onths are equally comforting. The
                        increase over the corresponding period , in 1905 is £1,497,800. The
                        Chancellor of the Exchequer, having in view the lowering of the duty on tea
                        and the repeal of the duty jon coal, calculated to receive in 1906-7
                        £1,223.000 less than in. 190545. To take the separate items :— There wqs an
                        estimated decrease of £2,245,000 ip Customs. But up to date the decrease has
                        only been £674,000) and even if wo arsume that this item will decline during
                        the current quarter by another £700,000; the total decrease will still fall
                        far short of the estimate. Excise, estimated to decrease by £30,000, shows
                        for the nine months an increase of £107,000. The Death-duties were, assumed
                        t> grow by £230,000, but the actual growth during threo-querters of the
                        financial year has been £1,495,000. The increase in the Income-tax Returns
                        was patat £150,000 ; it is already £167,000 And in "miscellaneous items" an
                        estimated deficit oh the year of ,£13,000 haa been changed to an increase on
                        the nine months of £336,800. One or two items, such as stamps, show more
                        than their eitimated decrease, and-it looks as if the Post Office and
                        Telegraph receipts might fall short of their estimated increase. But these
                        are minor figures com paled with the great totals of incroase. Mr Asquith
                        can scarcely avoid having in hand at the end.of the financial year a balance
                        over his estimates of something between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000, and if he
                        succeeds in effecting certain savings in expenditure, as seems probable, he
                        may have a surplus of from £6,000,000 to £6,000.000 At present, of course,
                        the trade prosperity is not lully rejected in the Revenue Returns, except to
                        some small degree in Customs. But a prosperous commerce, high wages, and
                        continuous employment are bound very-soon to give a new elasticity to the
                        revenue and next year we may look to see its effects. It is true that the
                        enormous receipts from .Death-loties last year were rather in the bature of
                        a windfall, arid that millionaires cannot be expected to die with such
                        regularity and profusion in every financial year. The objection is fair, but
                        it must not be pressed too for. It seems to us that evegy Chancellor of the
                        Exchequer is justified in Hooking for much larger receipts from the
                        Death-duties during he coming decade than have accrued during he past The
                        great fortunes have been most f them made within the last thirty years, and
                        heir possessors are only just beginning to dirt Ve should not be surprised
                        to see the Death-utiea double their yield during the next wenty years.</p>

                <head>EDUCATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Alured Bell write to the "Morning Post": Sir,- As your interesting
                        interview with Mr. Sidney Wellls the new Director-General of education in
                        Egypt, throws a good deal of light on one department of the British
                        administation, may I be permitted the opportunity of emphasising a few
                        points necessarily ignored io the impres-ionist opinion of a stranger to the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Tha national good wishes wi1l, accompany the ex Principal of the Battersen
                        Polytechnic in bis mission for the advancement of the Egyptian youth in
                        technical education, but it is no disparagement to him to say that no new
                        mantle can overshadow the remarkable education regime instituted by Lord
                        Cromer in 1890, and conducted with conspicnous success by Mr. Donglas
                        Dunlop, the Inspector General of Egyptian Education. I remember the time
                        when, for instance, tbe proportion of pupils in tte Government schools
                        learning French and English was, respectively. 80 and 20 per cent.; it is
                        now, I believe. the other way round, namely, 15 and 85 per cent, in favour
                        ot tha English language. All the superior colleges of which Mr. Wells
                        speaks, such as the Schools of Agriculture, Law, Medicine, and Engineering,
                        have been founded under the "old" regime, and Lord Cromer has given
                        expression to his innate missionary genius in promoting the entirely
                        un-Mohamedan cult of female education by establishing schools for Egyptian
                        girls. The progress of the Egyptian youth in technical educaiton is, in my
                        humble opinion, of far less moment than their progress in morality, logic,
                        citizenship, and government, and the basis of these things has been well and
                        truly laid during the last sixteen years. As a proof of this I would advance
                        the improvement in the character of the Egyptian Government employees, the
                        great increase in the publishing and clientele of native newspapers, and the
                        really remarkable tendency in the higher social circles towards monogamy and
                        the disuse of female seclusion.</p>
                    <p>The influence of the Oxford and Cambridge graduates whom Mr. Dunlop has
                        gathered round him as professors in the schools cannot be overestimated-it
                        is as real and permanent an influence as that acknowledged of his own
                        masters by the English public school boy. In a word deep inroads have been
                        made in the Oriental habit-of thought; Western, even British, ideas have
                        been inculcated; and it is on this groundwork that Mr. Wells will construct
                        his superior technical edifice. Lest he should, in his enthusiasm, be too
                        anxious for immediate results, may I venture to remind him of the Arab
                        proberb, "Harry is the Devil, slowness is of God."</p>

                    <p>The "Times" commenting on Kiamil Pasha's dismissal, remarks that the fact of
                        the late Grand Vizier's taking refuge in the British Consulate at Smyrnam
                        and the Sultan according to British demands for his safety affordss striking
                        tribute to British reputataion amoung the Muasnlman population. The

                        borne on the shoulders of eight men of the Intri-killing Fusiliers from

                    <head>THE RUSSIAN AGITATION.</head>
                    <p>YESTERDAY'S SCENES IN ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                    <p>To all outward appearance, Alexandria, ordinarily is peaceful on a Sunday,
                        seemed yesterday to be in the very throes of a revolution. The agitation in
                        favour of the release of three Russian refugees, who have been arrested by
                        the police on a very grave charge, and to which we referred on Saturday,
                        yesterday assumed much more serious proportions than were warranted by the
                        facts of the cave. Reedless of the diplomatic difficulties which stand in
                        the way of such a step, and regardless  of the Capitulations, a large
                        proportion of the European population of Alexandria is clamouring for the
                        release of thrre Russian revolutionaries, whose extradition they wish to
                        prevent—on grounds which are purely sentimental. However much we may
                        sympathise with the Russian revolutionaries in their strnggle with
                        despotism, any movement such as the present is greatly to be deprecated, and
                        we are surprised to see that a local contemporary has gone to such extreme
                        lengths in fanning an agitation which can be prodcotive ol no good.</p>
                    <p>The scenes in the streets of Alexandria both on Saturday and yesterday were
                        deplorable.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday, on a rumour being spread that the refugees had been embarked on
                        the Russian steamer for Odessa, a crowd of'manifestanta" nade their way to
                        the quay, shouting “Vive la liberty," and boarded the vessel with the object
                        of discovering whether the rumour was true. As it happened it was not, but
                        some ill-advised person in authority called out the Pire Brigade to deal
                        with the demonstrators. This measure only aggravated the situation, and gave
                        rise to incidents which might have been avoided by the exercise of more
                        discretion. The crowd attacked the Fire Brigade and did some damage to the
                        engine and hoses, while some horse play was indulged in. Order was only
                        restored by the arrival of H B. the Governor, who gave his personal
                        assurance that the prisoners were safe in custody, and that they would not
                        bo deported before a full enquiry was held into the case.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday something of the natnre of an attack was made on the Russian
                        Consulate in Ramleh-boulevard, ths consulate shield being torn down. A
                        cordon of police was afterwards formed round the consulate and traffic
                        stopped iu that part if the boalevard. The efforts ot the polioe to keep
                        people away from the vicinity of the building resulted in several scuffles,
                        but nothing of a very serious character happened, and after nightfall the
                        street returned its normal aspect, two sentries being left posted at the
                        consulate door. Several demonstrations took plsce in various parts if the
                        city daring the day, no'allly at the Bourse, where M Alfred Campos, as one
                        of the leaders of the agitation, connseled calm, wisely stating that their
                        object could not be attained by resort to force but by peaceful means.</p>
                    <p>Meantime the prisoners are incarcerated at Hadra prison, awaiting the
                        decision of the authorities. We believe that a solution of the dlfficulty
                        will be foundd in their being sent to one European port.</p>

                    <p>Meyervere's fine old opera "Qli Ugnnotti” was very well given on Saturday
                        night: it was the high level of the performances which we have yet seen.
                        Sig. Marchi Emilio is a most sympathetic Reoul, and, though laboring ’ under
                        'he disadvantage of a heavy cold, filled his exacting part admirably. We

                        ; and her difficult and involved gymnastics in the opper compass were most
                        cleverly and accurately handled by Sig Finizi Magrini. We will not deny,
                        however, that we feel, as it were, born out of due time for there intricate
                        cadences, which give one, like the longer trills in Handel's Messiah, no
                        definite pleasure, but rather a hauting terror that the strained performer
                        will break down, turning pathos into bathos. For the rest, Siz. Chotkowska

                    <p>(From Our Special Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Luxor Monday.</p>
                    <p>Tha inaugural proceeding at the new Winter Palace Hotel have been carried out
                        with such delightful entertainment and on such a lavish scale that everyone
                        who has partaken of the hospitality offered him is filled with regret at
                        their termination. Saturday's programme included the visit to the far famed
                        Tombs of the Kings for those who were energetically inclined, and a most
                        perfect lunch was served to those who preferred to spend their morning
                        exploring the various objects ot interest in the immediate
                        neighbourhood.</p>
                    <p>During the afternoon the workmen and builders who had labored so
                        conscientiously at their task were collected in the still unfinished garden
                        at the back of the hotel and there received the reward of their toil in the
                        shape of most congratulatory speeches from Mr. E. A. Harrison and Mr.
                        Splenon and substantial gifts, doles of meat being distributed to the men
                        and handsome watches being presented to those who had control of the various
                        gangs. Mr. Harrison indeed proved the presiding spirit at these, as at the
                        subsequent proceedings, being generous in the thanks he accorded to those
                        who had borne the burden and heat of the day, and hospitable to a degree to
                        all who, were present. As chairman of the Upper Egypt Hotels Co., he voiced
                        his committee in its expression of hope for a successful future. Mr.
                        Harrison has assuredly done his best to make that future a certainty. The
                        dinner hour was fixed for 7.30 pm., and the restaurant, brilliantly lighted
                        and tastefully decorated, was soon filled with guests. A long T-shaped table
                        was surrounded by notabilities from Cairo and the neighbourhood and
                        representatives of the press. We have not space to give the names of those
                        who were present. Enough that the dinner was admirable, and the future
                        visitors of the hotel should have the utmost confidence in the cuisine.
                        Speeches, dancing, bridge, and conversation followed the dinner, and in the
                        course of the whole of our Egyptian experience we have never known an
                        evening in which hospitality and informality were so delightfully blended,
                        and we have no hesitation in saying that if the Winter Palace Hotel
                        continues as it has begun it will be the most popular house of entertaiment
                        in the length and breadth of Egypt. The only cause for regret during the
                        above-mentioned proceedings was the absence of M. Pagnon, who, as proprietor
                        of Pagnon's Hotels and latterly as managing director of the Upper Egypt
                        Hotels, has proved himself to be one of the leading and most successful
                        personalities in Egypt.</p>

                        looks forward confidently to a successful and a long continued season.</p>
                    <p>The weather has been delightful. Even during the heat-wave that prevailed
                        further South a short time ago Luxor escaped it's intenisity, and now the
                        north wind has arrived, and, after a short break, the sun is once more
                        tempering its keenness, and warming the air as only Egyptian sunshine in
                        January can. It is well known to visitors who come to Luxor again and again,
                        that here is no climate of extremes. It is unusual to have either intensely
                        hot, or very cold weather, during the winter season, and its situation is
                        particularly sheltered from high winds.</p>
                    <p>Regular weekly Gymkhanas are now being held on the race-course just outside
                        the town. The third meeting of the season, on Thursday last, was a most
                        successful one. The usual native races were much appreciated by the many
                        strangers who filled the the grand-stand, while the three races for
                        visitors: gentlemen's donkey race, ladies' race, and goolsh-pegging were
                        well patronised and caused much amusement both for riders and spectators.
                        Baron Heintze, a well known visitor to Luxor, carried off the 1st prize at
                        the goolabs, and was also second in the donkey race.</p>
                    <p>A very enjoyable entertainment was given on Thurdsay evening on board the
                        Rameses III., when some extremely clever ticks of cards and sleight of-hand
                        were shown by Sir Alfred Cooperm who is making the Nile trip with his son.
                        Some charming music was also provided, the singing of Miss Reibold being a
                        specially great treat to those privileged to hear her. A collection was made
                        at the end of the evening for the Luxor Hospital for natives, which will no
                        doubt benefit to a considerable exxtent by the happy thought of those who
                        organised the show.</p>
                    <p>Among the visitors now at the Luxor Hotel are Bishop and Mrs. Whitehead of
                        Madras, who are making a stay in Egypt on their way to India, and Sir
                        Benjamin Stone, M.P. for East Birmingham, and well-known as a traveller and
                        as a clever and enthusiastic photographer.</p>

                <p>F.R.C.'s FIRST MEETING.</p>
                    <p>(From Our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>THe first meeting of the Fayoum Racing Club on their new course took place on
                        Friday, and proved an unqualified success, the attendance being extremely
                        large and some 42 horses entering for the five races on the programme. Amon
                        those present were the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior and Lady
                        Vicotira Machell, Captain Proheroe Smisth and practically all the Englishmen
                        connected any way with the province; while of the native notables frew if
                        any were absent. </p>
                    <p>The club has erected two pulbic stands and a third class enclosure, besides a
                        private stand; stalls are provided for 30 houses and a parimutual and a
                        buffet are included.</p>
                    <p>Anybody in serach of a boy who can ride 5 stone would find a treasure in the
                        rider of the winner of the third and fourth races. Though oonly a small
                        Sudannee boy of 10 years he rides with all the confidence of a crack light
                        weight at home, and with no little judgment. The following were the resutls
                        of the races:-</p>
                    <p>The Karoun Stakes value P.T. 800.</p>
                    <p>Abdul Wahed and Ahmed Fathi's Gazelle Mahomed Salah's Matrowie Mahomed
                        Basil's Assiury </p>
                    <p>13 started. Won easily by three length. The Club Stakes. value P.T. 600.
                        Abdul Washed and Ahmed Fatbi's Fritz Moward O'eilb's Kaahf</p>
                    <p>Shek Yesseen Abouel Mckaram's Tyar 6 ran. Fritz made practically all the
                        running and won in a canter by three lengths.</p>
                    <p>The Fayoum Stakes value P.T. 2500.</p>
                    <p>Mahomed el Basil's Fayoum 1</p>
                    <p>Mahomed Salah's Matrowie 2</p>
                    <p>Mahomed Abdul Hallaq's Farhan 3</p>
                    <p>5 ran. At the end of the first mile Matrowie seemed to have the race in hand,
                        catching up the leaders when akad without apparent effort, but entering the
                        straight Fayoum drew further away at every stride and won as he liked by 8
                        lengths.</p>
                    <p>The Pyramid Stakes value P.T. 1,000. </p>
                    <p>Mohamed Amin's Maurice 1</p>
                    <p>Moward Koleib's Ka-hf 2</p>
                    <p>Homamed Aly Byad's Kouisan </p>
                    <p>9 ran. a very hot pace soon produced a long tail with Kousan leading; in the
                        straight Kashf and Maurice both passed him, and maintaining his effort the
                        latter won a good race all out by a length and a half.</p>
                    <p>The fifth race somewhat failed in its object, it being intended for bona fide
                        fellaheen, with a special prize to the omdeh of the village from which the
                        winning horse came. Unfortunately I became known that the Moudir had
                        presented a gold watch for the winning omdeh, and though three horses were
                        sent back at the post out of the 15, the first three horses in the race
                        should also have been disqualified. Many difficulties occurred, but the
                        prizes were eventually awarded them.</p>
                    <p>The thank of the committee are especially due to Lady Victoria Machell for
                        kindly distributing the prizes, to the Moudir for his constant supervision
                        of the arrangements, and to Ahmed Eff Farhion whom most of the work has
                        fallen Mr. Miller kindly acted as starter, and Captain Prothero Smith as
                        judge.</p>

                    <p>Our correspondent at Medinatel Fayoum compalins of the indolence of the
                        Municipality whose intertia is responsible for the lack of drinking water.
                        He suggests artesian wells to replace the present supply of stagnant water.
                        The native members of the Municipality, he says, do not pay much attention
                        to sanitary rules, and their European colleagues have no time to see the
