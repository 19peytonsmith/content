                            <p>In his recently published report on the
                            Wakfs Administration Harari Pasha makes
                            some interesting remarks on the schools and
                            kuttabs dependent thereon, and on the effect
                            of the reforms introduced by the Ministry of
                            Public Instruction, which has of late years
                            taken over the administration of these estab-
                            lishments. Although the level of efficiency has
                            risen since these reforms were intitiated, the
                            instruction received by the children is of so
                            elementary a character that they are not
                            likely to be fitted thereby for a commercial or
                            professional career, or for the public services.
                            In 1901 Harari Pasha, realising the impos-
                            sibility, for the time at least, of effecting any
                            very general improvement, introduced a system
                            of selecting the pick of the boys taught in
                            these schools and giving them a professional
                            apprenticeship in the railway workshops, the
                            Boulac Arsenal, and other Government tech-
                            nical establishments. The apprentices spent
                            half their working day at the Wakfs schools
                            and half at the State workshops, but it was soon 
                            found (in 1904, to be exact) that the pupils
                            were too young to stand the fatigue of mani-
                            pulating heavy tools, etc., the Wakfs regula-
                            tions forbidding boys over 14 years of age
                            to remain at the kuttabs, and that their
                            school work suffered. Other boys made the
                            mistake, common in Egypt, of imagining that
                            a little learning had made them experts,
                            and promptly took service under masters
                            for a low salary, leaving school and work-
                            shops alike. These young paragons were pro-
                            bably soon taught by their employers to form
                            a more exact estimate of their own powers, but
                            by the time they had learnt that lesson they
                            could not profit by it. At present apprentices
                            who have given proofs of competence are given
                            certificate signed by the heads of the technical
                            establishment where they work, and can then
                            remain, if wanted, at these establishments or 
                            seek work elsewhere. Employers will probably 
                            seek work elsewhere. Employers will probably 
                          have the sense to select employers from among 
                          the holders of such certificates whenever pos-
                          sible, and if the experiment be persisted in, the
                          public will be the gainer. It is to be hoped
                          that both the Wakfs Administration and the
                          Ministry of Public Instruction will see fit to
                          continue and to extend the experiment, which
                          cannot be abandoned without, depriving a
                          number of boys of the chance of bettering their
                          position and becoming skilled workmen. In
                          these days when every young Egyptian seems
                          to aim at becoming a doctor, a lawyer, a State
                          employe, or a speculator, technical knowledge
                          and efficiency are two of the chief de iderate
                          of the country.</p>

<p>The officials of the Ministry of Communica-

officials of the Congress of Zemstvos in the city
and provinces. The Social Democrat leaders
have organised the sale of rifles and cartridges
to the strikers.</p>
<p>Remarkable scones have taken place at
Karkoff. 3,000 students held the University
for two days, erecting barricados. Arms were
obtained and distributed. Eventually a com-
mittee for the public safety was formed which
negotiated the Bartender of the University, on
condition that the students should leave the
barricades unarmed, but exempt from arrest
or prosecution.	(Reuter)</p>
<p>St. Petersburg, October 27.</p>
<p>General Trepoft has issued a stern warning
in which he says that he will nip the disorders
in the bud. He has ordered the troops and
police to suppress any outbreaks with ball
cartridge without hesitation.</p>
<p>A Decree prohibits meetings being held in
    Russian Universities.</p>
<p>Meetings of professional mess-here, compris-

<p>It is stated that 50,000 professional men
are involved, and the effect will be most disas-
trous if the strike last.</p>
<p>Martial law has been proclaimed at Karkoff,
but the strike movement is making headway
without disturbances. Fresh provisions are at
exorbitant prices here, and the garrison has
been placed on short rations. (Reuter)</p>

<p>“Orient and Occident."—We are pleased to
note that this excellent magazine fully main-

remarkably good articles on the moral training
of children—boys and girls—in purity. When
this series of articles is completed they will be
issued in pamphlet form (English and Arabic
in parallel columns), and extensively circulat-
ed in all the towns and villages of Egypt Such
a work as this should have an exceedingly
good, result for in Egypt, as indeed in most
countries, the inculcation of lessons in purity
is sadly needed.</p>
                    
<p>Wedding Party Attacked. — A serious
affray recently occurred near Lahoon, where a
certain Mohamed Mohamed El Khawly, Sheikh
of Nahier el Lahoon, and his brother, Kamel
Mohamed, headed a band of rogues and vaga-
bonds and attacked Awad Niad, in whose
house a wedding party was rejoicing. The
gang broke into the festivities at a late hour of
the evening and fell upon the wedding party
with nabouts, beating all who came in their
way in a most savage manner. The markaz
authorities were informed at once, and the
mamour, with a force of policemen and ghaffirs,
arrived and dispersed the aggressors, though
not before forty persons had boon injured.
Some of the gang were caught by the police on
their arrival, and by the close of the following
day all were in gaol.</p></div>

<head>THE NEW COMMERCIAL TREATY.</head>
<p>It is stated that the Greek and Egyptian
Governments have almost reached an agree-
ment on the subject of the alterations which
the latter Government wishes to make in
certain clauses of the treaty of commerce
existing between the two countries. Greece, it
is said, will allow gambling houses kept by
Greek subjects to be freely entered by the re-
presentatives of the Egyptian authorities.
Our Greek contemporary "Phos" adds that
to avoid any regrettable incidents a complete
list of these houses will be drawn up by the
Greek consular authorities. As to the question
of hashish cultivation in Greece, it seems that
the complaints of the cultivators of the Indian
hemp, from which the drug is prepared, have
made good their objections to the suppression
of its cultivation in Greece, and that the Hel-
lenic authorities have been compelled to adopt
a compromise by which the growers will have
to pay a heavy tax on all hashish produced.

                        <head>THE MEHKEMEH SHARIEH.</head>
<p>Two interesting stories reach us from Cairo
which show the need of reform in the
procedure of the Mebkemeh courts very
clearly.</p>
<p>The first concerns the old Continental Hotel
buildings in the Sharia Kaar-el-Nil, which
belonged to the late Sioufi Pasha. On his
decease some two or three years ago they
passed under the control of the Mebkemeh,
whilst the son and heir only enjoys the income
for life. A short time back one of the English
companies lately established in Egypt offered
to rent the whole block of buildings on a
12 years lease and to spend a large sum
in improvements and making rows of shops
right round, at the same time increasing
the present rental by £2,000 a year. After
long negotiations' the Cadi has finally decided
that ho cannot grant a longer lease than
three years, which is, it appears, the
longest the Mehkemeh Shariah allows on this
class of property. The result has been that
the company have withdrawn their offer.
The second case is that of a poor widow
who owns 1,100 eqoare metres ot land
in a commanding position in the Bab el-Louk
quarters, and on which there is an ancient
and tumble-down building, the rent of which
barely suffices for the needs of the woman
and her family.	 As the property is required
for improvements and has been offered £8
a square metre the site. She asked the
Mehkemeh to dispose of the land and invest
the proceeds in other property which would
give a far better return, but the Cadi re-
plied to the poor woman’s petition that the
site could not be alienated. As the owner
has not enough means either to improve
the building or to pull it down and erect
another, it must remain in its present tumble-
down condition, and the widow must content
herself with the pittance she now draws as
rent until such time as the ancient building
crumbles away.</p></div>

<head>PORT SAID STATION.</head>
<p>Last year, considerable inconvenience was
experienced by the hundreds of tourists who
came to Egypt and made Port Said their port
of disembarkation, on account of the scanty
accommodation which the railway station
offered to them. Everything that was possible
was done to make passengers, — who had often
to wait a long time for the departure for
the train,—comfortable, and many of them will
have pleasant recollections of being ushered
into the cosy office of the indefatigable super-
intendent, Mr. W. Watson, who strove so
effectually against the thousand and one dif-
ficulties which beset him.</p>
<p>But one small office does not suffice to
shelter eighty people or more from the wintry
blasts of Port Said. The Railway Administra-
tion has spent a very large sum of money
over this temporary station ; a large shed
has been erected for passengers' luggage ;
more commodious sheds have been erected for
the in-coming and out-going goods ; a wooden
pallisade protects the departure platform, and
a splendid buffet has been built, but it has
not been thought necessary to provide any 
other accommodation for passengers. Last year
even the buffet was not completed, and one
could witness numbers of people sitting on
the cold, draughty platform with but a box
for a seat. We are glad to learn that now the
conditions are somewhat ameliorated, and
that the International Sleeping and Restaurant
Car Company are going to open the buffet
on the 1st November, but we fear that more
cannot be done, as far too much has, in our
opinion, already been spent over this tempe-
rary station, and we cannot suggest or en-
courage further expenditure.</p>

<head>ARABS AND TURKS.</head>
<p>"Methinks the Osmanli doth protest too
much,”is the version of a well-known quotation
that comes to mind when we read in our
Turkish contemporary, "Shevrai Ummet,” that
no nation respects the Arabs more than the
Turks, and that no Ottoman soldier but feels
a qualm at the very completeness of the
victory over tho Imam Yahza. Our con-
temporary is, however, on safer ground when
it remarks that the rebellion in the Yemen is
a natural and inevitable consequence of mis-
government, and asks when the warring elements
of the Turkish Empire will be united by
education and a common patriotism.</p></div>

<head>THE ROYAL TOUR.</head>
<head>MOVEMENTS OF ROYALTY.</head>
<head>DEPARTURE OF RENOWN.</head>
<head>(From our Correspondent).</head>
<p>Port Said, Friday.</p>
<p>Those who hoped that the Prince and Prin-
cess of Wales would pay a visit to the town
of Port Said have been doomed to disappoint-
ment, as their Royal Highnesses have not
quitted the harbour for a single moment.
Great interest has been evinced on the part
of the population in the visit of the Heir-
Apparent, and large crowds watched the arrival
of the British warships from the quays. As the
Renown steamed slowly into the harbour
H.R.H. the Princess of Wales was seen to
take a number of snap-shots of the various
points of interest, in which occupation she was
assisted by one of her ladies-in waiting.</p>
<p>As soon as H.M.S. Renown had moored
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, who was on the
upper bridge, retired to his private saloon in
order to reoeive the officials who went on board
to welcome him, the first of whom was
Mr. D. A. Cameron, H.B.M.’s Consul, who
remained on board for half an hour. He was
followed by Major Watson, A.D.C. to the
Khedive, representing his Highness, Mr.
Doyen, of the Suez Canal Company, the police
commandant, and a few others.</p>
<p>Subsequently Major Watson, Captain Tot-
tenham (H.M.S. Lancaster), Captain Wemyss
(H.M.S. Suffolk), and Commander Bruen
(H.M.S. Surprise) had the honor of dining with
their Royal Highnesses.</p>
<p>Shortly after 9.30 this morning the Prince
and Princess of Wales, with a few of their
suite, left H.M.S. Renown and proceeded
direct to the Surprise, where they remained
till nearly 5 p.m. During the morning the
ship's band played, and continued to do so
until lunch was served.</p>
<p>This evening the Prince and Princess will
go on board H.M.S. Lancaster, and the Prince
is expected to ring the silver bell which was
presented to the vessel by the ladies of Lan-
caster a few weeks ago. Later in the evening
the Royal party will probably visit H.M.S.
Suffolk. H.M.S. Powerful arrived here at
2.40 p.m. to-day and is moored at black
buoy No. 7.</p>
<p>The Renown and Powerful are expected
to leave between 8 and 9 to-morrow morning.</p>
                                
<p>Port Said, Saturday.</p>
<p>Last night a reception and dinner, followed
by a ball, were given on board H M.S. Power-
ful, which sailed at 7.30 to-day. The Royal
party returned to H.M.S. Renown at midnight.
As stated by me yesterday, the Prince of
Wales rang the silver bell on board H.M.S.
Lancaster.</p>
<p>H.M.S Renown sailed at 6.30 to-day on her
way to India. H.M.S. Lancaster left for Malta
at nine, and the Surprise leaves for the same
destination to-morrow, to be followed by the
Suffolk on Monday.</p>
<p>The Royal party are due at Port Said again,
on their return from India, on April 29, with
the same escort of vessels as they have left
with.</p>
<p>All the ships in the harbour were decorated
yesterday.</p></div>

<head>TURKEY AND THE LEBANON.</head>
<p>A resident of the Lebanon who has just
arrived here informs us that the Ottoman
Government intends to establish four schools
in the Lebanon, one in the Meton district
and three in the district of Shouf. Two of
these are to be boarding schools, and Arabic,
French, and Turkish are to form part of the
curriculum. Muzaffar Pasha, the present un-
popular Governor of the province, has urged
the Turkish Government to open elementary
schools in the Lebanon, on the ground that
its people receive their education from British,
French, Russian, and American sources, and
are consequently inclined to support any
Power rather than Turkey. The new Turkish
schools are intended to create a spirit of
loyalty and devotion to the Sultan in the
Lebanon, but the hill people wonder if the
creation of sinecures is not the real motive
of the Mabein.</p></div>
                            
                            <div type ="item"> 
<head>TOR PILGRIM CAMP.</head>
<p>It is announced (says the “Times”) that the
Egyptian Government is making farther pro-
vision for extending the pilgrim camp at Tor.
A credit of £10,000, in addition to former
sums, is being allotted for this object, and the
erection of new buildings in the encampment
is reported to be making good progress. Many
of the sufferings formerly endured by the
poorer pilgrims will now be greatly alleviated,
if not entirely removed. The necessity for
these extensions is apparent from the fact
that, whereas on the establishment of the
quarantine camp at Tor the number of pilgrims
passing through totalled 13,000, the caravans
are now bringing some 40,000. This number
naturally includes only those pilgrims coming
from the north and west. Those travelling
from India and still farther east undergo
quarantine at the Turkish station on Camaran
Island, in the Red Sea. Particular regard is
being paid to the sanitation of the new ex-
tensions, and the most scientific arrangements,
compatible with the circumstances of the
place, are being designed.</p></div>

<head>PRO CALABRIA. </head>
<head>BENEFIT CONCERT IN CAIRO.</head>
<p>The grand concert which was held at the
Khedivial Opera House, Cairo, on Thursday
night, in aid of the victims of the recent
Calabrian earthquakes, was a great success,
though the support which was accord-
ed to the committee of the Cairo Musical and
Dramatic Society, under whose auspices it
was held, was not as general as it might have
been, and the house was not so full as we
should have liked to have seen it. Messrs.
J. W. Congdon, Felix Powell, Smith, and
Sergeant, who constituted the committee,
worked very hard and are to be congratulated
upon the results of their efforts. A letter
was received from H.H. the Khedive express-
ing his, regret that be would be unable to
attend, and the Earl of Cromer also wrote
wishing the committee every success. El Lewa
Lord Cecil Pasha, EL Lewa Bernard Pasha,
and Mrs. Palmer Chapman very kindly sent
subscriptions as they were not able to be
present. We must also mention the names of
Mr. A. Columbo, who very kindly provided
the plants and flowers for decoration, Messrs.
Press and Politis, who undertook the distribu-
tion of the posters, and Signor Vincenzo and
Granato-Mezzacapo, who lent the grand Stein-
way piano. Each of the ladies who assisted
was presented with a beautiful bouquet by
the committee.</p>
<p>The first item on the programme was Rossi-
ni's "Tancredi," played by the band of the
King's Royal Rifles in a manner which reflect-
ed great credit on Mr. J. Brown, bandmaster ;
the overture was admirably rendered and all
the instruments blended in perfect accord,
Mr. Congdon then recited the prologue, which
was composed by himself; we are sorry that
want of space prevents us publishing this
appropriate and well-written verse, which sings
the praise of Charity. At the conclusion of
the prologue Mr. Congdon waved a large
Italian flag and was greeted with rounds of
applause, and as the band struck up the
Italian national anthem the whole audience
rose to their feet. Miss Gertrude Simpson
then sang Sullivan's well-known ‘Orpheus
with his Lute”; Miss Simpson has a high
soprano voice which is well-trained and sang
excellently, finishing with a perfectly clear
high b without the slightest strain. Next
came a pianoforte solo by Mlle Schall, who
played "Les Soupirs" very well, and Mr. J.
Mattalon followed with the well-known oper-
atic air "Donna non vidi mai" from Manon
Lescaut. Mr. Mattalon has a very pleasing
voice and is a good musician, and his inter-
pretation of the air delighted the audience.
Herr Carl Goetz then sang "Tom de Reimer,"
by Mendelssohn, in which he was beard to
advantage. A military and descriptive sketch
entitled "The Royal Fusiliers" was next played
by Mr J. W. and Miss Laulie Congdon ; the
two characters of this short sketch are an ole
Chelsea pensioner and his little granddaughter,
and the old man sings a story of "Uncle
Fred's” bravery, which ended in death, during
the Crimean war. Though quite a child Miss
Congdon played her part unfalteringly and
with feeling, and Mr. Congdon gave a most
realistic description of his "brother’s” brave
act.Signor E. Mariani sang the grand aria from
Tosca and held the audience enraptured. In
all, Signor Mariani sang three songs, but this
was deemed far too little and he was most
enthusiatically applauded. He is the possessor
of a beautiful tenor voice and is a true artiste,
his rendering was faultless and his every noti
was followed and thoroughly appreciated by
all.</p>
<p>In the second part of the programme, which
was opened by the band with di Capua's “I
Berasglieri" and the intermezzo from Cavalleria
Rusticana, two artistes appeared whom we had
not heard in the first part, Messrs. Everard
and Wood. Mr. Everard played Beethoven’s
"Moonlight Sonata,"in which he showed him-
self a thorough master of the pianoforte and a
born musician, and we hope we shall have
further opportunities of hearing him. Mr.
Wood, who is the bandmaster of the Rifle
Brigade, is well-known to Cairo as a musician
and thoroughly sustained his reputation with
his renderings Moszkowaki’s Spanish dances
played as a violin solo. The concert was
brought to a conclusion shortly after eleven
with the Italian and Khedivial national
anthems and "God save the King.” Those
who took part are deserving of great praise for
the way in which they contributed to the suc-
cess of the evening, which we feel sure would
have been even greater had there not been the
counter attraction of the illuminated city an
the military band performance at the Continental
Hotel in honor of the H.H. the Khedive’s return.</p></div>

<head>SAINT ANDREW FOOTBALL CLUB</head>
<p>The annual general meeting of the above
club was held in the Church of Scotland
schoolroom on Wednesday evening last, when
the Rev. H.P.Reid presided. The attendance 
of members was exceedingly good, and there
is every prospect of a good season. The chair-
man congratulated the club on the successful 
season they had had last year, and also
referred to the sound financial footing on which
they were now entering upon the new season
The minutes of the last general meeting were
read and duly approved, and office-bearers for
the new season were then elected. The Rev.
H.P. Reid was unanimously re-elected president
of the club, and Messrs. W.J.B. Webb and
George Sweet were reelected secretary and
treasurer respectively. A committee was formed
of five members. The subscription for playing
members has been fixed at P.T. 30, and for
honorary members P.T. 20. The meeting closed
with a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman
The club opens its season to-day with a
match against the Departmental Corps, Royal
Berks, to take place on the parade-ground at
Mustapha Pasha barracks this afternoon at
3.30. The team will meet at Ramleh station at
3 p.m. It is hoped that members and friends
will turn out in good force to witness
this opening match.</p></div>

<head>LA SEMAINE</head>
<p>La taux d'escompte ayant remouté de 3 1/2
a 4 % vendredi dernier toute la semaine s’est
ressentie de ceste accentuation de la tension
monetaire. Aussi assistons-nous depuis samedi
a une suite ininterrompue de baisses jusqua
ce matin ou comme c’est l’habitude apres des
fluctuations exagerees, une petite reaction en
hausse s’est produite en depit de l’augmenta-
tion du taux prive d’escompte de 4 a 4 1/8,
Ii n’en est pas moins vrai que la speculation 
reste perplexe et semble attendre que la situa-
tion monetaire se soit eclaircie pour s’engager
dans de nouvelles affaires, Et en cela nous ne
prouvons que l’approuver. Si, en effet, la Banque
d’Angleterre est obligee d’augmenter encore
son taux d’escompte, une nouvelle baisse sir
toutes les valeurs est inevitable.</p>
<p>D’autre part, une catastrophe n’est plus a 
craindre, les positions etant peu surchargees et 
tout le monde se tenant a lecart dans l’attente
des evenements. Ce n’est dono pas uniquement
aux difficultes faites par les banques locales 
qu’il faut attribuer le marasme actuel de-notre 
marche, mais encore a l’abstention de la specu-
lation dont les disponibilties se feront jour des
que la disparition de la tension monetaire et le
ralentissement des affaires en coton permet-
tront aux valeurs de reprendre leur essor.
Le 7 du mois prochain aura lieu simulane-
ment a Rome, a Paris etten Egypte l’esmission
a € 8 des 100,000 actions de €. 5 de la Ban-
que d’Abyssinie Il n’y aura ni Privilegiees ni
Parts de Fondateurs.</p>
<p>Fonde Par un groupe de banquiers egyptians,
associes a des groupe de banquiers egyptians,
associes a des groupes anglais, francais et
italien, le Credit Franco- Egyptian a rencontre
un plein succes pour son emission. Le Capital 
est de 12.500.000 francs. A la tete du groupe
francais se trouve le Credit Mobilier Francais.
Dans le courant du mois prochain en lancers
au Caire la nouvelle societe “National Hotels
and Residences” au capital de 200.000 L.E.,
divise en 50,000 actions de 4 L.E chacune et
2,000 parts de Fondateurs. 30,000 de ac-
tions sont reservees a la souscription publique,
le reste etant deja souscrit par des particuliers.
La Societe a pour but l’acquision di Nation-
al Hotel et des blocs attenants ainsi que de
l’Hotel-Casiono de Ain Sofar (liban) avec ses
dependances. Apres le paiement des frais et
l’affection de la somme fixes pour la reserve
statutaire, il sera distribue un premier divi-
dende de 5% aux actionnaires. Le solde sera
partage de la u aniere suvante: 80% aux ac-
tionnaires et 20% aux Parts de Fondateurs.
Une autre emission qui a determine une
hausse sensible sur la Banque d’Athenes au
moment ou toute la cote flechissait est celle de 
la Societe pour l’exploitation des raisins de
Corinthe. Elle Aura lieu aussi dans le courant
du mois de Novembre.</p>
<p>On ne chome pas en Egypte pour la creation
de nouvelles societes. Il ne se passe guers de
semaine u quelque combinaison nouvelle ne
surgiise, ce qui est un indice de la propserite-
du pays et de l’abondance des capitaux, mais
il n’en faut que veiller davantage au placement
de son argent.</p>
<p>La Banque Nationals flechit de 27 1/8 a 
26 3/4, la Delta Light de 12 13/16 a 12 9/16,
la Daira Sanieh de 17 13/16 a 17 1/2, l’Agricole

American Nile de 5 7/8 a 5 3/4 et la Delta 
Land de 2 1/2 a 2/ 1/4.</p>
<p>Sur les petites valeurs la baisse est moins
sensible. Elle est de 3/32 pour le Trust a 1 1/4 et de
1 32 egalement pour les Estates a 1 1/8. 
Les Cotton Mills perdent 4 pence 1/2 a 5/1
et la Salt & Soda 1 shelling a 32/3, pendant
que la Filature regagnue 1/32 a 27/32 et les
Markets 3 pence a 25/9.</p>
<p>Les Tramways  d’Alexandrie eloturent a 163
les Privelegiees et a 33 les Dividendes, en
baisse de 10 frances pour les secondes. Les
recettes vont toujours en augmentant. 
On constate une reprise de 1/16 sur les
Eaux d’Alexandrie a 14 15/16 et une chute de
15 frances sur les Eaux du Caire a 1115.
Tandis que les Privilegiees Crown Brewery
reculent de 202 a 200, les Dividendes remon-
tent de 109 en 112.</p>
<p>Les Brasseries des Pyramides, par contre,
flechissent aur toute la ligne: les Privilegiees
de 1 4 a 120 et les Dividendes de 60 a 55.
L’Obligation Credit Foncier Egyptian reste
stationnaire a 314 1/2, la Nungovich a 10
11/16 et le Cheikh Fadl a 124.</p>
<p>La Cassa di Sconto gagne 6 frances a 185 et
la Banque d’Athenes 3 frances a 136 1/2. Des
affaires ont eu lieu aux nonveaux cours.
De 9 9/16 la Land Bank tombe a 9 1/2 et 
l’Urbaine de 5 1/4 a 5 3/16.</p>
<p>Les Buildings Lauds cloturent aussi en
baisse a 4 7/32, l’Oasis a 1 1/16, le Comptoir

tian a 32/3, l’Union Fonciere a 6 5/16 les
Egyptian Hotels a 2 9/17 et les Upper Egypt
Hotels a 5 1/8.</p> 
<p>On voit par cet ensemble que les valeurs
accusent cette semaine une nouvelle baisse
generale. Mais la chute des cours est relative-
ment peu considerable et se trouve amplement
justifiee par la tension monetaire, l’attention
qu’on porte aux cotons, et l’abstention de la
speculation qui attend des jours meilleurs.</p>

<p>(Avj urd’hui d midi et demie)</p>
