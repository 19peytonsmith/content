MANCHURIA.
COMPANIES AND SPECULATION.
In view of the mass of new companies which
have been already totaled in Egypt, and which i
ire still appearing on tho horizon, one wel-
comes any publication which takes a sane
view of the situation, and is based on common j
tense. The first number of ‘‘La Revue Inter-
nationale d'Egypte” has just appeared, and it:
contains an article by M. Leopold Jullien on ;
“La Situation Economique de l’Egypte,” which •
is well worth perusal. M. Ju'.liea points out
that formerly there wore few company shares!
dealt in on the Bourses of Alexandria and i
Cairo, as shares were held by large capitalists, j
and only small lots were available for the
public; but all that is now in god, and the
public are entering on share speculation in any
company which is presented. It says though
wealth of the public aid the bushel spirit of eater- j
prise would be a matter of congratulation if
the situation were normal, but, hi add*, this
infatuation of the public is not normal and
tho position of the share market is becoming
more dangerous. In this we omit. The
rashing up of new companies to a premium
before they have begun operations is quite
without justification on any solid business
grounds, and equally arousing is the fall,
after a week or two, when some other company ;
has appeared, of the same shares to a discount.
The fellah buys land and borrows money
and all Egypt lives on him. If Europeans have
acquired wealth in Egypt, tho fellah is the
basis of it all. Railways, ports, import and
export houses are all for the fellah, fur there
are no industries in the country. Truly the
Egyptian Atlas has a heavy load on his
back : a land tax of £4,750,000, interest
on 30 millions private indebtedness, say
£2,250,000, and rout on 6,000,000 feddans,
say £18,000,000. The new companies have
two foots stated above, "the fellah buys
land and borrows m mey”—an 1 subiidiary
to that people living on him need houses.
There are three geographical words: Egypt,
Nile, Delta; four financial words, Land, Bank,
Trust, Investment. All that is needed is a
clean sheet of paper and a fluent pen, and
perhaps a little historical knowledge of what
other companies did which were established
long ago under different conditions. With
this stock-in-trade a proipectus is easily pre
pared, no originality is needed. An infatnatod
public apply for shares, not because they wish
sound investment, but to get shares of goo<i
speculative character. M. Jullien restates u
good many facts which have already been
eet forth by other authorities, and they all
go to prove the soundness of laud values in
Urn* but as he points out, it is difficult to
proprietors know 19 little of</p></div>
