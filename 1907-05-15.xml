                        <head>A FREE SUEZ CANAL</head>
                        <p>In their wildest dreams, shipowners have never looked forward to a
                            toll-free Suez Canal They have at various intervals pressed for and
                            obtained reductions of the transit dues but it has been reserved for Mr.
                            Asquith, in his speech to the Colonial Premiers to promise co-operation
                            with any practical proposals for “removing or reducing" the Canal
                            Company’s charges. That the Imperial Government should even so much as
                            hint at the possibility of abolition is one of the ironies of the
                            situation. Only lost March there was published a correspondence between
                            it and the Governor-General uf Australia (Lord Northcote), in which
                            Colonial request for assistance in securing a further reduction'of the
                            Canal dues was oold shouldered, with the joint approbation of the
                            Colonial Office, the Foreign Office, and the Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Lord Elgin was sympathetic - on paper— but thought “nothing would be
                            gained by an attempt to pursue the object without due regard to the
                            interests of those who have a purely financial concern in the
                            undertaking." The sentence gives the key to the position The Suez Canal
                            is the property of a company, in which French shareholders predominate
                            Great Britain must therefore act circumspectly, notwithstanding the
                            unique influence she possesses* as a result of Lord Beaconsfield’s
                            master-stroke in purchasing the Khedive’s shares in 1875. Great Britain
                            is represented on the administration of the Suez Canal by three
                            Government directors - Sir Henry Austin Lee, Sir John Ardagh, and Mr. H.
                            T. Anstru- ther. They advised the present Government, after Lord
                            Northcote’s letter had been referred to them for consideration,. that
                            although the Suez Canal does pay a dividend of 28 per cent, the profits
                            are not exhorbitant, in view of the history and circumstances of the
                            company, and the fact that the shareholders are called upon to make
                            considerable sacrifices for the widening and deepening of the Canal,
                            which they could not be expected to continue if the does were further
                            cut down To put the matter briefly, the British Government could not, if
                            it would, coerce the Suez Canal administration into a disregard of the
                            fair claims of its shareholders. Any attempt to do so would evoke the
                            open hostility of France, which, it may be assumed, has not acquiesced
                            in our present supremacy in Egyp- without some guarantee for the due
                            protection of the great waterway, which the world owes t&lt;- the “Grand
                            Fraiirais," and in which French investors are so deeply concerned.
                            Therefore, the “removal’’ of the Suez Canal dues as a whole is out of
                            the question, for a Chancellor of the Exchequer who wants to lay the
                            foundations ol old-age pensions is not going to embark on so colossal
                            and impossible an enter prise as the buying out of French interests
                            What, then, as to the reduction of the Canal dues I The simple fact is
                            that these have, since Jan. 1, 1906, stood at the lowest point on
                            record—namely, 7f 85c per tou. They liave dropped to this point from the
                            9f 50c charge 1 in 1892, and from the 12f or 13f levied in the earlier
                            years of the concession. It is true that British shipowners claim that
                            the reduction should have proceeded even more rapidly, under an
                            agreement or understanding with M. le Lesseps, but they have hitherto
                            been unable to induce any British Government to acquiesce in that
                            contention and press it home.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the outstanding fact in the history of the Suez Canal
                            is that, if French capital built it, it is British shipping which has
                            made it a financial success. Here are figures showing the net tonnage of

                        <p>not quite fairly represent the commercial position, because if warships,
                            transports, and Government chartered vessels are left out of account,
                            and consideration is given to merchant vessels and vessels in ballast
                            alone, the British flag stands for nearly 76 per cent of the total
                            tonnage of that class. There is striking proof here, not only of the
                            commanding positiou of our mercantile marine, tut of the fact that the
                            Suez Canal is the great highway to and from our vast possessions in the
                            East and in Australasia. This artificial waterway of ninety- nine miles
                            in length through tho sands of the desert is the connecting link of the
                            British Empire, and for that reason it is a legitimate aspiration to
                            desire that it should be as free as the Atlantic to the Empire's
                            shipping. Then arises the question whether Mr. Asquith, as Chancellor of
                            the Exchequer, is ready and willing to assign towards the realisation of
                            this object the revenue which the country derives from its Suez Canal
                            shares. A further question is as to how far that revenue would go in the
                            desired direction. Here we come to figures which show the shrewdness of
                            Lord Beaconsfield’s investment. It is estimated that the whole cost to
                            this country of its Suez Canal shares, with interest at 3$ percent, per
                            annum, had been repaid by the dividends reoeived before the end of 1899.
                            Since that date the country has received in further dividendaa sum of
                            between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000, and may expect to go on drawing
                            considerably over £1,000,000 a year for something which now stands in
                            the nation's books as having cost it nothing. It is fair to suppose that
                            Lord Beaconsfield’s object was less to make a good business bargain for
                            the country than to secure a share in the oontrol of the Suez Canal.
                            Shipowners, at all events, argue that it is not right for the country to
                            go on pocketing profits at this rate, and to do nothing for British
                            shipping, when two-thirds of those profits arise from dues paid by
                            British ship-owners. There is something in that contention—more,
                            possibly, than in the Argument that steamers in the Australian trade
                            which now go by way of the Cape would all use the Suez route if the dues
                            were lower. Notwithstanding, there can be no qoarrel with the principle
                            of the Colonial demand that, in the interests of inter-imperial trade
                            and immigration, the shortest route to and from Australia should be as
                            far as possible cheapened. If the propriety of stimulating
                            inter-imperial trade by removing or reducing the canal dues at length
                            appeals to the Government, how is Mr. Asquith placed ? He has a million
                            and rather more of Suez Canal income, bnt, on the assumption that
                            British shipping contributed in proportion to its tonnage to the
                            £4.500,000 which roughly represented the transit receipts of the Canal
                            Company in 1905, he would need * a total ot close on £3,000,000 a year
                            in order to free British shipping. In other words, he- would have to
                            find nearly £2,000,000 from other sources than Suez Canal profits. This,
                            however, would be on the assumption that every ship with a British
                            register was entitled to a rehate representing the amount paid for canal
                            dues, whether she was trading between British ports or not But as the
                            object aimed at is the encouragement of inter-imperial trade, it would
                            probably be essential to discriminate, and to say that if a British ship
                            is bound, say, from London to Japan, she shall not be reimbursed her
                            canal dues, but that if she is bound from London to Melbourne, Calcutta,
                            or Singapoie she shall get her canal dues refunded. Possibly by some
                            such prooess of discrimination the British Government’s share of Suez
                            Canal revenue could be so eked out as to accomplish a great deal, but
                            the thing would be fraught with the gravest difficulty and complexity. A
                            British steamer, for instance, loads cargo for a British possession in
                            th9 East, partly at home and partly at a Continental port. She would
                            presumably be denied the right to a rebate representing her canal lues,
                            because she is not wholly engaged in inter-imperial trading. Equally, if
                            she shipped a cargo in Australia, and discharged some of it at
                            Mediterranean ports and the bulk in London, she might be disqualified.
                            What with the trouble of proving to official satisfaction that the
                            ship’s voyage was wholly inter-imperial and the formality of recovering
                            from the Government in London the rebate equiv- ilent to free passage
                            through the canal, the scheme seems cumbersome to a degree. By
                            omparison, indeed, the Colonial proposal to ^ive a preference to British
                            goods actually landed in the Colonial port seems simplicity itself. It
                            was easy for Russia to pay the Suez Canal lues for the ships of her
                            volunteer fleet, which were neither merchantmen nor men-of-war. i'heir
                            tonnage was, however, relatively so small that the experiment can hardly
                            be said to count. But Mr. Asquith, apparently without lue consideration,
                            has given his approval to a programme which is positively staggering It
                            is doubtful whether he can have reflected that directly he took steps to
                            make the Suez Canal toll-free for oar shipping, or a section of it, our
                            maritime competitors would at once do the same. In their case the task
                            would be relatively easy. German shipping comes next to our own among
                            the users of this international waterway, but it equals only a quarter
                            of the British total, and could thus be freed altogether for a trifle of
                            £750,000 a year provided by the German Government. Whetlier, when Mr.
                            Asquith spoke of co-operation in a practical proposal for “removing or
                            reducing” Suez Canal dues, he had doubts whether such a thing would ever
                            be forth-coming, it is useless to discuss. But the irresistible
                            conclusion is that the freeing of the canal is out. of the question till
                            the concession expires many years lienee, and that the further reduction
                            of dues is mainly, if not solely, possible by those methods which in the
                            past have certainly not been wholly wanting in success.As an alternative
                            to Colonial prefer- , ence, at all events, Mr. Asquith’s scheme ia

                <p>The Greek Chamber of Commerce, Alexandria, has just published its report for the
                    pas't year. Imports from Greece last year amounted to L.E. 321,793 as compared
                    with L.E. 121,467 in 1900, and L.E. 85,858 in 1896. Tobacco chiefly accounts for
                    these large and steady rises, the increase in the past six years in that import
                    being from L.E. 71,716 to L.E. 214,968. The import of Greek wines has similarly
                    increased from L.E. 5,502 in 1900 to L.E 22,867 in 19&lt;i6; oils from L.E.
                    2,226 to L.E. 10,247 : brandy from L E. 3,233 to L.E. 1.1,347 ; fruits from L E.
                    5,581 to L.E. 10,509; soap from L.E. 3,863 to L E. 6,946. During the lust ten
                    years the number of Greek steamers trading in Egyptian ports has increased from
                    22, with a total tonnage of 22,119, to 253, with a total tonnage of 194,293.</p>

                    <head>MK. FOX BOURNE’S LETTER</head>
            
                <p>In Monday’s issue we reproduced a letter from the “Times,” written by Mr. Fox
                    Bourne, the Secretary of the Aborigines Society, who stated “that the main body
                    of Egyptian reformers, whose principal organs are “El Moayad” and “El Minbar,"
                    are nut in harmony with the reckless policy of Mustaplia Kamel Pasha and his
                    followers, whose organs are “El Lewa” and its English and French reproductions,
                    the “Egyptian Standard” and the “Etendard Egyptien ”</p>
                <p>This assertion has deeply pained the organs of Mustaplia Pasha Kamel.</p>
                <p>The “Egyptian Standard” remarks :—</p>
                <p>“Frankly we did not expect such a peculiar attack from the quarter which it comes
                    from Mr. Fox-Bourne isthe author of “Lord Cromer's Supremacy" and other similar
                    pamphlets in tending to show by the simple force of reading data in Parliament
                    and in printed books that Lord Cromer had introduced an autocratic form of
                    government not in agreement with either English or Egyptian interests. Mr. I’ox-
                    Bourne spoke from dry paper lore He had no experience in Egyptian matters and
                    this unconscious want was felt in every one of his pamphlets. The same
                    inexperience is visible in his letter to the “Times.” It can hardly be an
                    exaggeration for us to state that, beyond the names of the two Arabic papers he
                    cites, Mr Fox Bourne knows next to nothing connected with them.</p>
                <p>“This, in itself would be excusable, as is all ignorance. But what we have to
                    refute with all our energies, is that thereis a “split” among the Egyptian
                    Nationals, or that there are Nationals parties. Such discussions do not, exist
                    How is it possible 1 Can one nation prodace two nationalities? Can one oppressed
                    nation produce two or three National parties, each struggling for a liberty
                    which is not the same liberty ?</p>
                <p>“Mr. Fox Bourne ought to recognize the truth of the above statement. Perhaps he
                    does, hut it is not his wish to reveal it.</p>

                <p>The following particulars of the Egyptian trade in watches and clocks are taken
                    from the "Bulletin" of the French Chamber of Commerce at Alexandria :—Exporters
                    to Egypt should hear in mind that .there are three distinct classes of clients
                    to be dealt with in that country—the European colony, the Arabs with a veneer of
                    European habits, and tastes, and the vast mass of the natives untouched by
                    Occidental influences, anil numbering ten times as many as the first two classes
                    combined. Each of these categories must be served according to its tastes. The
                    natives it. general, and more especially the lower orders, have quite a mania
                    for watches, take a delight in studying their mechanism and in many cases buy a
                    fresh one nearly every year. Under these circumstances it is only natural that
                    Egypt should be considered a good market by makers of various nationalities, and
                    that numerous kinds of watches should be on sale. In large towns such as
                    Alexandria nnd Cairo several well-equipped jewellers' and wutchmakers’ shops are
                    established, some being branch houses of European firms ; these are visited
                    yearly by large numbers of commercial travellers, who are prepared to make all
                    possible concessions and stretch the limits of credit to the utmost degree with
                    a view to securing orders. In addition to these large establishments a
                    considerable number of native watchmakers, trading on a small scale, arc to be
                    found in all Egyptian towns, in many villages, and even in the remote districts
                    of the Sudan. These are largely supplied by commission agents, although a
                    certain number ileal direct with wholesale houses. Men’s watches arc
                    considerably more in demand than those for ladies, gold and silver watches being
                    in demand for both categories, while in the former, -nickel and gun-metal
                    watches are even more largely sold. As regards clocks, wooden regulators of all
                    sizes and round nickel alarms find the largest sale ; ornamental mantelpiece
                    clocks are practically unknown. Switzerland has by far the greatest share of the
                    trade in cheap watches, and, moreover, sends a certain number of better-class
                    go-xls of special makes. Germany predominates in the clock trade, furnishing an
                    enormous number of regulator and alarm clocks at exceedingly low prices.</p>

                    Egyptian Government after the expiration of his leave on 15th September.</p>
                <p>Borton Bey was bom in 1870. He was educated at Bedford School, and then entered
                    Sandhurst. He obtained u commission in the Welsh Regiment in 1890 and entered
                    the Egyptian Army in 1897. He served in the Nile Expedition and after the fall
                    of Omdnr- man was specially promoted to the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and
                    specially mentioned in despatches. He was then sent by Lord Kitchener to Dongola
                    as one of the first Anglo-Sitdane.se civil officials in that part of the Sudan.
                    He was in charge of the Dongola province for some time and then went to Khartoum
                    in order to form a Prisons Administration for the Sudan. After that he was
                    appointed Governor of Suakin in succession to Miralai Playfair Bey.</p>
                <p>He was .subsequently appointed commandant of the Upi>er Nile district. From that
                    post he was nominated director of the Custom Administration in the Sudan In 1904
                    he came to Alexandria in order to study the customs system of Egypt. His Sudan
                    official career was, however, interrupted by his being offered the post of
                    Assistant Postmaster General, which he accepted. Borton Bey has resided at
                    Alexandria since that date. His appointment as successor to Saba Pasha will be
                    very generally appreciated as he has made himself very popular since his

                <p>Sir,—We have the honour, sir, to beg you to publish the following few lines in
                    your valuable paper :— On reading the examination of mathematics that was set to
                    the subordinate certificate students we have seen in too difficult, especially
                    in algebra and geometry. Article No 8 in the ‘‘Official Journal” states that
                    taking cipher in a subject or in a branch of it will lie a cause to his failure
                    in all the rest of the examinations. We were present, on that day when all the
                    pupils went out of the examination. We have seen that at least 80% of the
                    pupils did not solve exercises of geometry and algebra thoroughly well. We
                    think, sir that no one of all the students had solved the three, or two
                    exercises of geometry.</p>
                <p>Therefore, we beg you, sir, to add your voice to ours in order that the Ministry
                    might l>e easy in correcting the niathemetic papers.</p>

                <p>The “Standard" publishes the text of the remarkable first will made by the late
                    Cecil Rhodes, and recently referred to by Earl Grey in a speech at New York. The
                    will is dated September 19, 1877, when Mr. Rhodes was only 23 years old, and
                    was, in the words of Earl Grey, “trekking over the boundless plateaus of South
                    Africa and sleeping tinder the stars.” In this will, Mr. Rhodes bequeathed
                    everything he had to trustees, who instructed to apply his estate towards the
                    establishment of the following objects :—</p>
                <p>“The extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system
                    of emigration from the United Kingdom, and of colonisation, by British subjects,
                    of all lands wherein the means of livelihood arc attainable by energy, labour,
                    and enterprise, and especially the occupation by British settlors of the entire
                    Continent of Africa, the Holy I*and, the valley of the Euphrates, the islands of
                    Cyprus and Candiii, the whole of South America, the islands of the Pacific not
                    heretofore possessed by Great Britain, the whole of the Malay Archipelago, the
                    seaboard of China and Japan, the ultimate recovery of the United States of
                    America as an integral part of the British Empire, the consolidation of the
                    whole Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the
                    Imperial Parliament, which muy tend to weld together the disjointed members of
                    the Empire, and, finally, the foundation of so great a power ns to hereafter

                  <div type="item"><head>MR. HOHLER’S REPORT-</head>
  
                <p>Port Sudan is the new name given to an inlet on the west coast of the Red Sea,
                    formerly known as Sheikh Bargout, 700 miles south of Suez and 35 miles north of
                    Suakin. There is a break in the dangerous coral reefs which fringe this coast,
                    and a straight channel with deep water gives an easy access to the mouth of the
                    harbour. The mouth lies at a slight angle to the general trend of the coast, so
                    that the reefs outside form a shelter from the heavy seas brought in by
                    southerly and easterly winds. The entry is about 500 yards wide, and this
                    breadth continues for nearly a mile. Then the inlet expands into a basin on the
                    south side, which is some 900 yards long by 500 yards broad, having a minimum
                    depth of 6 fathoms Beyond this, the channel runs up into the land for a distance
                    of about 2 miles. There is another basin on the north side about 1 $ miles up,
                    and a third at the end of the inlet. For 1 mile after leaving the first basin
                    the water has a -minimum depth of 9 fathoms with an average width of 200 yards.
                    The minimum depth the whole way up is 2j fathoms. ..The narrowest part of the
                    iidet is aliout 70 yards. The shores rise to a height of from G to 14 feet abo>e
                    sea level, and are composed of coral. The hot flat plain around is devoid of
                    vegetation except for stunted mimosa thorns. A line of hills rises 10 miles to
                    the west, running parallel to the coast</p>
                <p>These are the natural features of the Sudan in which it was decided three years
                    ago to construct the terminus of the Sudan railways Work was begun less than two
                    years ago, and the transformation which has been effected in this dreary
                    wilderness iB extraordinary.</p>
                <p>The Sanguineb lighthouse, 16 miles out to sea, marks the passage through the
                    outer reefs, while the nearer approach is shown by pointers (1 HO feet high) and
                    beacons. The railway terminus and custom-house have been placed on the northern
                    side of the inlet, and quays are in process of construction along this side. It
                    is expected that berths for two ships will be ready by the autumn of 1907. When
                    completed the quay will he over lj miles long with accommodation for 12 or 14
                    ships. Electric travelling cranes and coal-hoists are being constructed. Pour
                    fine customs sheds are already in use. The railway at present has to make a long
                    detour to go round the head of the inlet, but a bridge is being built which will
                    be available for every kind of traffic and thus unite the two parts of the port.
                    It will open so as to afford nccess to the upper waters of the inlet, where a
                    dock with the necessary shops have already l)een commenced.</p>
                <p>The present terminus of the railway, conjoined as it is with the custom-house ard
                    the quays, will jeinain the goods station. The passenger station will he placed,
                    as soon as the bridge is finished, on the south side of the water, that is to
                    say to the west of the town.</p>
                <p>On the south side of the inj^t coining from the sea an infectious diseases
                    hospital and a quarantine station have been constructed. The basin mentioned
                    above cuts these off most effectually from the town which lies between this
                    basin and the spot selected for the station, having a wn£er frontage of almost a
                    mile. In this space broad streets have been laid out at right angles. Some of
                    the Government buildings are already nearly completed. For the rest, pending an
                    arrangement of the land question, to which I shall refer later on, the town is
                    at present composed of temporary wooden buildings, occupied by a population of
                    about 5,000. Water is laid on from wells to houses belonging to Government and
                    also to a series of hydrants in case a fire should break out, a grave danger,
                    increased by every factor: a hot climate, wooden houses, inflammable goods,
                    prevalent wind and indifferent oil lamps.</p>
                <p>A scheme is ih hand for bringing water from a reservoir which is to be
                    constructed in the hills, some 25 miles away. At present the inhabitants fetch
                    their water from the wells by donkeys Good drinking water has to be brought from
                    a distance of about 7 miles.</p>
                <p>A branch of the Gordon College has leen built, and u civil hospital is in course
                    of construction.</p>
                  </div>
              <div type="item"><head>CLIMATE.</head>
                <p>The climate is essentially bad and unsuited to Europeans. The malarial mosquito
                    has not yet made its apj>oarance, but there are fears lest it should he conveyed
                    from the Nile valle) by the railway. Simple fever is common -. it generally
                    assumes a violent form and leaves the patient extremely depressed and enfeebled.
                    Cases of sunstroke are particularly frequent The inconveniences of extreme heat
                    such ns might be expected in the Red Sea, are enhanced by extreme damp. During
                    the summer months, especially July, August and September, even night brings no
                    relief, the temperature remaining practically unchanged, so that sleep is almost
                    impossible. The “cold weather” in this region is merely a relative term. No
                    European should stay there without a good yearly leave, and it appears
                    undesirable that he should remain during two consecutive summers.</p>
              </div>
              <div type="item"><head>A SANATORIUM.</head>
                <p>It is possible, however, that in time a sanatorium will be formed in the hills
                    behind Suakin. There the conditions are totally different A reasonable
                    temperature is ensured by the altitude, and a dry bracing desert air replaces
                    the depressing, relaxing damp of the coast. It is probable that in no part of
                    the Sudan, and in a few parts even of Egypt, is the climate better and more
                    agreeable than in the Hadendowa Hills.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to write of Fort Sudan without making constant references to,
                    and comparisons with, Suakin. The main reasons for which the railway terminus
                    was transformed to the former poyt is She vastly greater safety of its sea
                    approach, and the superiority of its harbour accomodation.</p>
              </div>
               <div type="item"><head>COMPETITION WITH SUAKIN.</head>
                <p>The future of Fort Sudan depends entirely on its importance as a port of entry
                    and a forwarding station. For these purposes it has already superseded Suakin,
                    hut the old town will die linrJ, if it die at all. The pilgrim traffic to Jeddah
                    will always pass through it—this year the number of pilgrims expected is about
                    8,000, and as a native centre it is likely to muintaiu its position. The lower
                    classes come over to Fort Sudan to work, but they return to Suakin to spend
                    their earnings. There area number of families—merchants, sheikhs, who
                    have lived for generations in Suakin, and there they will remain. The merchants
                    are sending their Rons, however, to Port Sudan, to start a branch of their
                    business there. Next, the quantity of cotton which is grown at Tokar is
                    considerable, and is increasing. Last year 60,000 can tars or unginned cotton
                    were produced, and this year over 80,000 cantars are expected. This cotton is
                    sent down toTrinkitat, whence it is carried by boat to Suakin. The cotton which
                    is grown at Kassala is also, at present, sent down to Suakiu by caravan. A
                    ginning factory was recently established, but proved a failure. The cotton ib
                    exported from Suakin to Egypt and is mixed with the Egyptian produce.</p>
                <p>It is, however, not impossible that with the future development of the country,
                    Suakin may become a cotton centre of some importance. It is also, at present,
                    the seat of a trade in cattle with Erithrea, Abyssinia and the adjacent
                    districts, though this traffic has been subject to great hindrance lately owing
                    to the prevalence of cattle plague.</p>
                <p>Senna also reaches Suakin by caravan.</p>
