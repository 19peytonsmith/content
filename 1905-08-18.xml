                    <head>Army Reform</head>
                    <p>It is the opinion of many thinking soldiers, who observed with discernment
                        the trend of public feeling after the war in South Africa, that a golden
                        opportunity was then lost by the Government, and that, if we had possessed a
                        leader alert at the time to observe and resolute to seize the chances that
                        were offered, the British Army would not now have been in a situation which
                        we have all to deplore. Instead of being the Army accura-tely described by
                        Lord Roberts as unfitted for the purposes of a great war, it would have been
                        a force engaged in embodying and training a new Army based upon the
                        universal training of the nation. What is it that gives the British Empire
                        its weight in the councils of Europe at the present time—upon what do the
                        groupings of foreign politicsnow chiefly turn? That weight is gained from,
                        and those groupings turn upon the strength and efficiency of a great Navy
                        built up and organised to a specific and known purpose, with the effort of a
                        consistent and unchanging policy. Wherein, on the other hand, lies the
                        weakness that endangers our position, and that menaces us with the gravest
                        danger that can ever threaten any 8tate? State weakness lies in the failure
                        to provide an Army adequate for the enormous demands which may be summed up,
                        as a standard of strength, in the defence of Afghanistan against a
                        first-class military Power—a defence, be it remembered, to which we are
                        pledged. Bismarck is credited with having made the cynical but sagacious
                        remark that “les faibles sont faits pour etre manges par les forts,; and
                        little as we may like the brutality of such statements, they are
                        demonstrably and palpably true. There can be no further excuse,
                        therefore,for ignoring the Empire’s need, which, as Lord Roberts said at the
                        Mansion Housed is the sufficiency and organised efficiency of the armed
                        forces to undertake a prolonged war in support of our national interests
                        against a great Power. This we may describe as the root problem now before
                        the Government. It cannot be solved in the imminent breach. It must be
                        solved now, once and for all.</p>
                    <p>Ministers should not cherish any feeble illusion on this matter. Their
                        proposals have so far touched only the outermost fringe of a great subject,
                        but their opportunity is not altogether lost We do not believe it to be the
                        settled mind of the British public to reject a doty assumed by every other
                        great people. Englishmen are awakening to the national need. Let the
                        Government, therefore, go to the country with the great demand. They will,
                        at least, have acquitted themselves of a supreme duty, and have brought
                        universal service into the domain of practical politics. They have a case
                        that is unassailable. They have endeavoured without success to make an Army
                        out of what we already possess, and, failing, they ask for more. They have
                        the teaching of all history, and all experience to prove that only the
                        strong are secure. It is not a vast standing Army that we require. Invasion
                        we do not contemplate, but, with a trained nation, all fear of descents on
                        our shores would disappear. If we had the Army of our need there oould be no
                        questioning of the attitude of France at the present hour. France and
                        England, equally strong at sea and on land, could defy aggression, and
                        impose peace upon the world. With an Army based upon universal servioe we
                        should possess that power of military expansion which would enable ns to
                        mobilise reserve after reserve, strengthening and reinforcing the regular
                        forces in any part of the world, until the will of the nation was
                        enforced.</p>
                    <p>Though Lord Roberts has given the weight of his high authority to the demand
                        for an army capable of indefinite expansion, as he told his hearers at the
                        mansion House,</p>
                    <p>neither the Royal Commission nor other endeavours have so far had any real
                        effect. We do not desire to see Army matters made an affair of party
                        politics, but it seems to us dangerous to wait for any slow movement of
                        public opinion, and we see no other way than for the Government to take the
                        country into its confidence. They can admit their errors as readily as Lord
                        Roberts admitted, at the Mansion House, the he made in recommending Mr.
                        Brodrick to open three years’ recruiting. The primary consideration must be
                        the Regular Army, brought up to adequate strength by proper treatment, with
                        the great reserve of officers upon which we insisted last week, and the
                        importance of which Lord Roberts has since enforced. Then would come the
                        universal training of the people, and, as the Field-Marshal said, a
                        necessary part of any scheme would be the training of all boys aud youths,
                        up to the time of their reaching the military age, in drill and
                        rifle-shooting. The subsequent training would not be burdensome. It might
                        take the form of periods of embodiment in a reorganised Militia, after which
                        men would be drafted to the reserve of the Army, with liability to serve in
                        great national emergencies. Lest it never be forgotten that these reserve
                        troops would not be put,in the field at the first outbreak of war, They
                        would be embodied for training, and be despatched to the front as
                        reinforcements, just as the Japanese have despatched their reserve men to
                        Manchuria. There would be a great demand for officers, but the organisation
                        of the men would be easy. The system could be in-troduced gradually. It
                        oould begin with training in schools; it could be continued with boys’
                        brigades and cadet battalions ; it could be extended by embodiment in the
                        Auxiliary Forces ; and afterwards, if necessary, could be completed by
                        definite territorial organisation with permanent cadres. The opportunity now
                        arises for placing this great issue before the country. It is not
                        conscription that is required, but merely a system of individual training
                        throughout the nation, and we hope the Government will recognise and
                        proclaim the necessity.</p>
