                            <p>Admiral May and other naval officers were prominent at the great
                                review at Longchamps on the occasion of the 14th of July. Sir L.
                                Bertie, British Ambassador, presented Admiral May to President
                                Loubet. The British officers at Brest likewise attended a review of
                                marines and seamen. There was much international enthusiasm.</p>

                            <p>Chamber of Deputies.—The Nationalist M. Lasies denounced the
                                inclusion in the amnesty of the “low reptiles” that General André
                                employed to spy upon their comrades. This caused an uproar, and M.
                                Berteaux, Minister of War, in a very excited condition after such an
                                insult, refused any longer to support a Bill which mainly benefits
                                the Nationalists. The sitting was suspended on account of the
                                tumult. On the resumption M. Rouvier read a decree closing the
                                session, and the Bill is thus wrecked. The Cabinet subsequently
                                recommended President Loubet to pardon all whom the Bill would have
                                benefited, but M. Deroulède and others will probably not accept
                                this.</p>

                                was discovered there on the 11th inst. There have been 12 arrests,

                        <p>The festivities held annually by the French colony of Cairo, in
                            celebration of the great events of the 14th of July have once more been
                            a thorough success.</p>
                        <p>A reception of the chief members of the French colony took place at the
                            French Consulate at 10 a.m. and M. Bousquet received his guests with his
                            usual warmth.</p>
                        <p>Many of the larger buildings in the princi- pal streets of Cairo were
                            decorated with tricolour flags, and Sharia Kamel in particular presented
                            a very gay appearance. Many of the French establishments were
                            illuminated after sunset, and the Esbekieh Gardens, which were the scene
                            of the principal festivities, were most effectively decorated; and the
                            numerous Chinese lanterns, gas jets, and coloured electric globes, which
                            had been arranged in most artistic designs, gave a most picturesque and
                            fairy-like look to the gardens.</p>
                        <p>The gates opened at 9 p.m. and large crowds at once streamed in. M.
                            Bonsquet was greeted on his arrival by the strains of the
                            “Marseillaise,” played by the two military bands and a string band which
                            were in attendance. The French anthem was repeated on the arrival of M.
                            Bonin, who is replacing M. de la Boulinière in Cairo, and arrived at
                            9.30 p.m., followed by Mr. F. W. Machell, who had been deputed to
                            represent H.B.M.’s Agency, and was greeted by the British national
                            anthem.</p>
                        <p>The principal attractions of the evening were supplied by the bands of
                            the Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Egyptian Cavalry, who played
                            alternately, by the variety entertainment of the fall troupe of the
                            Nouveautés music hall, and by a pyrotechnic display. The fireworks were
                            unfortunately somewhat affected by the damp, and the set-pieces were to
                            a great extent hid by clouds of smoke. The rockets, Roman candles, etc.,
                            were far more successful. The fireworks over, many of those present
                            began to dance and continued dancing to their heart’s content till after
                            2 a.m.</p>

                            abilities and intimate acquaintance with the local omdehs and notables,
                            apart from his geological knowledge of the Oases, will be of inestimable
                            value to the Corporation. Mr. Beadnell is well known as the author of
                            numerous reports and works on the geology of the Oases and district of

                            <p>Yesterday, the sunken dredger Pharaon II. was, by the aid of the
                                Canal Company’s shear legs, turned over on to the cradle which had
                                been prepared for its reception and sunk to the bottom of the
                                harbour. I learn from one of the engineers who are at work on her
                                salvage, that the original idea has been dropped and that she will
                                be raised by means of iron lighters, which have been bolted together
                                on pairs and will be sunk, attached to the cradle, and then pumped
                                out. Their lifting power is theoretically 1,200 tons.</p>

                            <p>In commemoration of the French national fête there has been arranged
                                for this evening an illuminated Venetian procession, to consist of
                                upwards of 200 boats of all sizes. There will also be an orchestral
                                concert, which is to be followed by a firework display. The town is
                                one mass of flags and Chinese lanterns, and as in former years,
                                crowds of people fill the main streets and cafes.</p>

                            <p>Reliable information regarding railway improvements here, in view of
                                the neat alterations which the Matarieh Canal and port changes will
                                bring about, is most difficult to obtain, but levelling and
                                road-making operations are to be seen both on Dowrie point and
                                behind the railway station. The end of this point is to be cut away
                                to make the harbour wider, and on the remaining land warehouses are
                                to be constructed. The back of the railway station land abuts on
                                that portion of the lake at which the town terminus of the Matarieh
                                Canal will be cut; this is all being levelled and marked out in lots
                                ready for occupation in the near future.</p>

                            <p>The inauguration of the new mosque took place at noon to-day
                                precisely. The Mosque Abbas has been over two years in construction
                                and was very beautifully decorated for the occasion. The ceremony
                                was conducted by Sheikh Abdul Game], in the presence of H. E. the
                                Governor of Port Said and of Abdul Hakim Pasha, who had come from

                        <head>THE SPECIALISING OF ROLLING STOCK IN EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>The growing tendency in Egypt is to order specially designed
                            rolling-stook to suit the requirements of the goods to be carried, and
                            to discard the heterogeneous and out-of-date collection of wagons which
                            had found their way into the country from all sorts of sources. British
                            makers have cause to be thankful for this, as the bulk of the orders are
                            now being placed in their hands. This policy is not merely confined to
                            the Government lines, but private companies are following suit.</p>
                        <p>A case in point, and one which serves to show also how great and growing
                            an industry is scientific farming in the land of the Pharaohs, is
                            afforded by the eight special bogie wagons ordered from the Leeds Forge
                            Co. by the Société des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d’Egypte for one of
                            their private lines. These wagons have been designed wholly and solely
                            for the purpose of transporting steam ploughing engines and their tackle
                            from one district to another to enable them to enlarge their field of
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>Each wagon is provided at one end with a ramp, hinged to the headstock of
                            the underframe, which can be lowered on to the rails, and a hand-winch
                            at the other end, to enable the ploughing engine to be hauled on to the
                            wagon or removed therefrom. When the wagons are running the ramp is
                            lifted to a vertical position, and there secured by stays. The buffers
                            on the ramp end of the underframe are hinged at the bottom, so that by
                            taking a cotter out of the top they will drop out of the way of the
                            ramp. Struts are also placed under this end of the wagon, which require
                            to be adjusted slightly above the rail level to take a portion of the
                            weight while the engine is over the same, thus preventing the underframe
                            being strained through the whole of the load being carried by one bogie.
                            It is not necessary, however, to use these struts when the plough or
                            cultivator is being placed on the wagon, as these machines are, of
                            course, considerably lighter than the engine. The struts can be placed
                            out of the way on a hook under the headstock when the wagon is running.
                            The ramp is raised and lowered by passing the rope from the winch
                            through a snatch-block, which is attached to the underframe and then
                            over struts on the ramp. The struts can be lowered to the level of the
                            floor out of the way when the engine is being hauled up the ramp.</p>
                        <p>When power is required for lifting the engine, the same snatch-block is
                            used. The rope is attached to the engine, passed through the block and
                            back to a hook under the winch. The winch is designed to give a pull of
                            three tons from the barrel when working in double purchase—i. e., a
                            total pull of six tons is available when using the snatoh-blook on the
                            engine for hauling the latter on to the wagon. The weight of the
                            ploughing engine is twenty- two tons.</p>

                        <p>(“Al Lewa.’’)</p>
                        <p>Chief administrator of the Moslem Benevolent Society, member of the
                            Legislative Council and of the Supreme Council of the Wakfs, Sheikh
                            Mohamed Abdou was without doubt the most learned man in the Moslem
                            world. Though many of the newspapers of Egypt disagreed with his views,
                            yet all lament his loss, which affects not Egypt only but the whole of
                            Islam.......Before he breathed his last the Sheikh uttered the following
                            verses:</p>
                        <p>"I care not what has been said of Mohamed Abdou by those who gather
                            together and exult over his death.</p>
                        <p>"But our Faith I have endeavoured to reform.</p>
                        <p>“Fearing its ruin by those who wear turbans.</p>
                        <p>“Every living being has hopes that he longs to accomplish.</p>
                        <p>“If I die all my hopes will come to naught</p>
                        <p>"O God, if Thou wilt, heal me or take me to the other world.</p>
                        <p>“Bless the world of Islam and grant it good guidance, an enlightened
                            guide, the path of righteousness in the darkness of night”</p>
                        <p>(“Al Mokattam.”)</p>
                        <p>Our relations with the Grand Mufti, Shaikh Mohamed Abdou, were intimate
                            and friendly before the rising led by Arabi Pasha, and our friendship
                            was renewed during the residence of the exiled Sheikh in Syria. Our
                            friendship was no mere matter of intimacy, but was based upon the
                            harmony of our principles on all matters connected with the Welfare of
                            Egypt We both realised the inconvenience arising from the attitude of
                            those who opposed progress with no arguments but those of
                            ignoranoe.......Egypt has sustained a loss which will be hard to remedy,
                            a loss whose results God only can know. The most enlightened and
                            advanced man in Egypt, his teaching was a light to the minds of the
                            students and Ulema and to all who longed for something beyond the old
                            theories, which did not satisfy the needs of the modern social
                            system....Again, the deceased was most anxious to see the results of his
                            work, and was a really great reformer and seeker after Egypt’s welfare.
                            As a teacher and expounder of religious theory to the students of Al
                            Azhar, as an enlightened author, as manager of ancient schools and
                            administrator of numerous benevolent societies, he was known to all. His
                            reforming influence was made manifest in the Legislative Council, while
                            he was ever ready to defend his faith against insult. He was constantly
                            employed on charitable committees formed to assist the victims of fire
                            or other misfortunes. He always endeavoured to prevent any cause of
                            hostility between Egyptians and foreigners.........and before the era of
                            legality he did not fear the despotism of the Government, but his
                            defence of liberty of action and thought brought him trouble throughout
                            his life.</p>

                            <p>Dear Editor,—The death of the Grand Mufti, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, is a
                                great loss not only to Egypt but to every Mohamedan country. It was
                                the privilege of the writer to spend some days with him before he
                                went to Alexandria, and to love him as a son loves his father. In
                                this age of the world civilisation, although still very faulty,
                                teaches us religious toleration. The Moslems need to learn this
                                lesson as well as the Christians. It is very difficult, but we know
                                the grand old Sheikh had learned it well and was not afraid to teach
                                it against most fanatic opposition. It is a most worthy object,
                                especially for us young men, to ever keep alive the memory of this
                                gentle, loving, wise man, who was forced to lay down his work before
                                he wished—and who was so active in his love for God and Egypt to the
                                very last. Let us study his life and be influenced by it</p>

                            <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                            <p>Sir,—Might I trespass upon your valuable space to draw attention to a
                                most serious matter affecting the public, or at least that portion
                                of it who live at Ramleh,—I refer to the running of the tram cars on
                                the Alexandria and Ramleh railroad. Surely some system may be
                                devised to prevent the overcrowding of the San Stefano cars. Could
                                it not be arranged that they stop only at the small stations, i.e.,
                                Carlton, Sporting Club, etc., and pass the larger stations; as it
                                seems to me the latter are very efficiently attended to by the
                                Palais cars. It is no uncommon sight to see the San Stefano cars
                                absolutely filled, and people hanging to the outside, while a Palais
                                car comes along with plenty of room. Doubtless this is well known to
                                the officials of the line, but for some inscrutable reason it is
                                allowed to go on. After all, it is only in keeping with the terminus
                                at Alexandria, where passengers have to stand in the sun and dust,
                                in the dustiest corner of the city, while waiting for a car ; and
                                this has to be borne from a company that, I am informed, pays a
                                dividend of 20 % - I am, etc.</p>

                            COMPANY</head>

                        <p>The statutory meeting of the Egyptian Land and General Trust Company,
                            Limited, was held in London on the 6th inst, at Winchester House, Old
                            Broad Street, Sir Willing F. Haynes Smith, K.C.M.G., LL.D. (chairman of
                            the company), presiding.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary having read the notice convening the meeting,</p>
                        <p>The Chairman said : Gentlemen, as you are aware, this is the formal
                            statutory meeting of our company, at which I have to inform you that the
                            requirements of the Companies Act have been complied with, and that we
                            are now in a position to deal with the business brought before us. The
                            company was incorporated on March 27th, 1905, and the necessary
                            certificate to commence business was obtained on April 11th, 1905. The
                            capital offered for subscription was £200,000, in £1 shares. These were
                            very largely over applied for. To give the exact figures, applications
                            were received for 941,438 shares, of which 584,160 came from Egypt, and
                            the remaining 357,278 were received in London. The company was formed
                            without the assistance of any promoter, and the expenses, which were
                            clearly stated in the prospectus, were paid by the company. With the
                            exception of these expenses, which were exceptionally small, the company
                            started business with its capital intact. Egypt and its affairs are now
                            so well known that I need not allude to the opportunities for
                            remunerative business on a sound basis which can be there obtained. All
                            those interested in the country have learned to wait for, as one of the
                            events of the year, the publication of the annual report of Lord Cromer,
                            showing in detail the continuous records of that marvellous development
                            of the country on all sides, year by year, under the direction of one
                            master mind, which has attracted universal attention. Still, it may be
                            of use to draw attention to a few of the more salient facts—such as the
                            increase of revenue, which last year amounted to L.E. 13,906,152, and
                            was L.E. 2,406,000 in excess of the estimates. Again, the increase of
                            its trade calls for attention, for the imports last year were valued at
                            L.E. 19,889,000, or L E. 3,742,000 more than in 1903, while the exports
                            were valued at L.E. 20,316,000 or L.E. 1,200,000 more than in 1903. This
                            is exclusive of the tobacco trade, which alone is of large dimensions.
                            Every year a stream of gold flows into Egypt, supplied by the increasing
                            numbers of people who visit it for amusement or health or business.
                            Large additional areas are brought under irrigation,and the productive
                            land yields its continuous crops to the patient and laborious
                            cultivator, who is thrifty and lives on little, while he is careful of
                            his money. Wealth is thus accumulated, and there appears to be a strong
                            tendency to invest these savings in land, thereby creating a steady
                            market. As illustrating the disposition of many of the Egyptian
                            investors, it is striking to notice the rising prices quoted for leading
                            stocks in Egypt. The investor there does not appear to look so much to
                            present dividends as to the property and reserve funds acquired by the
                            different corporations. Land and its development is naturally one of the
                            investments which first attracts attention, and although various
                            companies have been recently formed with the object similar to our own,
                            yet there seems no reason to doubt that there is an ample field open for
                            the profitable use of our capital if judiciously invested. The company,
                            in dealing with Egyptian affairs, has the advantage of the services of
                            three directors in Egypt, who have your confidence. These directors are
                            His Excellency Crookshank Pasha, the British representative of the Daira
                            Administration; Mr. Lonsdorfer, the well-known merchant ; aud our
                            Agent-General, Mr. Hooker, who is well known in respect of his public
                            services in Egypt, and greatly respected. As out distinguished director
                            Crookshank Pasha is so intimately connected with the Daira
                            Administration, perhaps you will forgive me for shortly drawing your
                            attention to some of the published results. The whole of the debt is to
                            be liquidated in October next. The rent roll has been increased to no
                            less than L.E.1,094,815. or an average of L.E. 6,52 per acre. With
                            respect to the value of the land, Crookshank Pasha writes as follows :
                            —"With the conversion of the basin irrigation in Middle Egypt into
                            perenoial irrigation, and a constant supply of good water assured by the
                            Assouan dam and Assiout barrage, I am confident that we have not yet
                            reached the highest prices that the land is worth.” This is a view which
                            is shared by many other high authorities. To the same effect is a record
                            of the sales of the Domains’ lands last year, when 2,958 acres were sold
                            by auction. They were estimated at £26 6s per acre, and realised £64 17s
                            per acre. Dealing with agricultural lands, there appears to be a great
                            opening for our comjany in acquiring land which requires reclamation. In
                            any such case, our company would honestly mean to reclaim land
                            thoroughly within a fixed period, and when this was completely effected,
                            sell it in suitable portions, to the small proprietor. I had some years
                            ago to endeavour to assist a somewhat similar class in analogous
                            conditions, and, speaking generally, I can only say that they rendered
                            an exact fulfilment of their obligations, that there were no bad debts,
                            while the investment was remunerative. An important point in connection
                            with these questions is that under the Land Department of the Government
                            it is easy to obtain a registered title, while the fee on transfer has
                            been reduced from 5 per cent. to 2 percent. Dealing with the questions
                            immediately before the directors, they have in hand important business
                            for the acquisition of lands in Cairo. Our agent general, Mr. Hooker,
                            considered it of such moment that he came specially to England to</p>
                        <p><cb/>confer with the board, and your directors, after going into the
                            matter most carefully with him, as a result of their investigation
                            authorised him to at once return to Egypt to carry out the transactions.
                            You will readily understand that it is inexpedient at present to go more
                            closely into details of pending business,but thedirectors consider that
                            the arrangements when completed will be entirely satisfactory to the
                            shareholders. Besides dealing with land in Cairo, the board have now
                            under consideration the question of acquiring and developing lands in
                            Alexandria for building purposes. In this and all other similar cases
                            the object of the board is only to enter on transactions if the prices
                            are such as to offer a good opening for remuneratively employing a
                            portion of its capital. Your directors have other important business
                            under consideration which is not ripe to put before you to-day. I regret
                            that the company are unable to participate in the issue of a company for
                            the development of one of the large mining concessions on the lines
                            intended, but there are various other enterprises connected with the
                            development of land in Egypt which are now being worked out, and the
                            question as to how far these can be advantageously supported by the
                            company will come before the board. It is not merely that the large
                            centres like Cairo and Alexandria are greatly extending, but improvement
                            is manifested in all parts of the couutry. I can testify to the striking
                            object-lesson of the effects of the administration in Egypt, which is
                            having a marvellous effect in various parts of Asia Minor and the
                            Levant, and people are leaving these latter countries and abandoning
                            property for which they have paid large sums in order to open business
                            and carry on their transactions in Egypt. In one of the important towns
                            on the Syrian coast—in Beyrout—this emigration of those engaged in the
                            largest business has produced a marked effect. It has been represented
                            to us that many of the Egyptian investors desire to pay for their shares
                            in full and obtain bearer warrants, and to meet this demand the
                            directors are having them prepared, and they will shortly be issued to
                            those who desire them. In laying before you so far as I can properly do
                            so the action of the board during the very short period since the
                            company has been formed, it is, of course, necessary to be reticent as
                            to pending business, but I think the shareholders may be assured that
                            the prospects open for the employment of the capital of the company are
                            likely to be fully satisfactory to them, and the company has every
                            prospect of entering upon sound business which must develop and
                            increase, and which, with the continued prosperity of Egypt and its
                            growing volume of trade, must yield good results. In the meantime the
                            capital of the company, while employed on investments realisable at
                            short notice, remains available for the enterprises in prospect, and the
                            shareholders have the satisfaction of knowing that the company has been
                            inaugurated and formed and brought to its preseut position at the least
                            possible cost. As His Excellency Crookshank Pasha is here, I am sure you
                            will like to hear a few words from him. (Hear, hear.)</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Crookshank Pasha said that, as the only member of the
                            Egyptian board present in England, he felt it his imperative duty to
                            attend the meeting and emphasise what the chairman had said with regard
                            to Egypt and investments there. He was particularly interested in Egypt
                            and had a great belief in its future. Things marched slowly in the East,
                            but although they had only been in existence a quarter of a year they
                            had already achieved a very considerable success. He was very glad to
                            hear from the chairman that the business they had taken in hand with
                            regard to the purchase of building land in the heart of Cairo was well
                            on way. The difficulty there was that before finally closing the
                            business they have to be quite sure that the title deeds were absolutely
                            correct. When that was done everything would be straight sailing. With
                            regard to Alexandria, that was a large and prosperous oity, and was
                            every day extending all round. They fully expected to establish a very
                            remunerative business, but things did not progress quickly in Egypt.
                            Contrary to the general rule, however, the price of land had gone up in
                            a few years in the most extraordinary way. It was only within the last
                            few years that people had begun to realise what could be made out of
                            land, and this applied to building land as well as to agricultural land.
                            Land which not many years ago could be got at £20 to £30 per acre could
                            not be purchased now under £70 or £90. Again, land which not many years
                            ago was offered them at something under £1 or 15s. a metre could not be
                            purchased now under £10 a metre. The result was that a large number of
                            companies had been started, but they could congratulate themselves on
                            being first in the field, and he had great faith in the future of the
                            company.</p>
                        <p>A vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings.</p>

                        <head>MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL. NEW DOCK OPENED BY THE KING.</head>
                        <p>King Edward VII. left Lord Derby’s residence at Knowsley on Thursday,
                            accompanied by the Queen, and travelled from there to Manchester, where
                            he opened the new dock which has been added to the Manchester Ship Canal
                            at a cost of £500,000. This new dock, the entrance to which is on the
                            Old Trafford opposite the grain elevator, has been named the King’s
                            Dock. Its length is 2,700 feet, its breadth 250 feet, its depth 28 feet,
                            and it has a water area of 15 acres, so that it is one of the largest
                            docks in the United Kingdom and will accommodate any of our largest
                            vessels. It has been constructed in a series of masonry pier and arches
                            so that when a large vessel enter the "wash" will not be felt by other
                            vessels moored to the quay, as would have been the case were it built of
                            solid masonry. Its steam and electric cranes, subway haulage, quay
                            tracks, sidings, and shed, will enable an unlimited amount of cargo to
                            be dealt with.</p>

                        <p>IX.</p>
                        <p>When my conversation with the Tcherkess had died through the exhaustion
                            of our vocabularies, M. Nicola reappeared and insisted that I should
                            dine with him at the restaurant. There we repaired and in due time got
                            our allowance of vermicelli soup and poached eggs with mastic and
                            glasses of a strong wine. Some Turks and Italians sat there and cracked
                            jokes with the owner of the tent, a grossly fat personage who now and
                            again sang snatches of songs and then clapped his hands and broke into
                            the howl of the Arab <hi rend="italic">claqueur</hi>. When we left the
                            tent it was bitterly cold (40% Fahrenheit) and I felt myself turning
                            blue, and wondered no more at the sweaters with which the Turks clothed
                            themselves. I was told that water froze on the desert—which is a good
                            3,000 feet above sea level—till May on cold nights, and that the wind
                            and cold made the winter very trying. Once in bed I got warm enough in
                            no time, the bloodthirsty Circassian giving me a hide of some sort to
                            add to my covers. It had a bad smell but I was too tired to mind, and I
                            slept the sleep of the just till 4 a.m., when I got up and made ready
                            for the morning train. I left at 5 a.m, after quite an agitated scene
                            with M. Nicola, who would not accept a piastre from me and was insulted
                            by the offer, asserting that all Christians in the East should help one
                            another— a most excellent rule, which I followed by leaving a small
                            bottle 2/3rds full of brandy under his desk when he was not looking. I
                            slept in the train till we got to Jurf el Derwish, when some severer
                            jolts than usual aroused me. Some very black Bedouins got in here and
                            promptly took off most of their clothes and slept in their cloaks on the
                            floor.</p>
                        <p>The end of the carriage was screened off for a harem with red curtains.
                            Two Turkish ladies, wives of officers at Ma’ân, were behind the curtain
                            attended by a coloured maid and a little boy. No one treated them with
                            any thing but the strictest politeness, and one Arab, who I think must
                            have been the soldier servant of one of the officers, put goulehs of
                            water in through the curtain from time to time, and when we reached the
                            grassland, gathered flowers by the track and handed in rough nosegays.
                            He also acted as nursery governess to a small boy who ran in and out of
                            the "harem” end of the carriage and chattered fearlessly to the
                            Bedouins, who were hugely pleased, and asked him if he would care to
                            come and live with them in the desert.</p>
                        <p>One incident which amused me greatly happened about 40 minutes north of
                            Jurf el Derwish. We were descending an inCline with three sharpish
                            curves where the brake was usually put hard down. But the brakesman had
                            curled himself under a seat and we had taken the incline at the alarming
                            speed of 15 miles an hour. The guard suddenly realised the situation. He
                            screeched at the greaser and prodded him with a bayonet, he dragged him
                            from under the seat, and flung him on to the brake at the end of the
                            carriage amidst a variety of curses. We took the next two curves much
                            more quietly.</p>
                        <p>At Katranéh the Circassians got into the train. They were perhaps a dozen
                            of the finest-looking msn I have ever seen, tall, clean-limbed, aud as a
                            rule curiously fair. They looked far more like Germans or Swedes than
                            Orientals, aud the imagined contrast between these men and the childish
                            and noisy fellaheen of the type one meets too often in Egypt was
                            painful. These men were the very antipodes of the Egyptian in their
                            quiet manner, their air of alert repose, and above all in the way they
                            eyed the people who were to travel with them. There was none of the
                            rustic cheeriness of the fellah, nothing of the somewhat artificial
                            manner of the Gallicised Bey or Effendi of Egypt. These people were
                            simply well-bred cowboys with just a touch of truculeuoe in their walk
                            and the look of their eyes. One of the Bedouins woke up while the
                            Sharaksa were getting into their places, and said something to his
                            friend which was obviously insulting to the new comers. A Circassian
                            heard and turned round, turned away, and turned again on the Bedonin
                            smiling unpleasantly with half a snarl on his lips. As he smiled he
                            played with his revolver. The Bedouin glared angrily at him for a moment
                            or two and then his gaze dropped before those merciless blue eyes aud he
                            looked first at the floor and then at nothing. The Circassian turned and
                            talked quietly with his fellow troopers, now and again looking back, but
                            the Bedouin did not watch him anymore but lay back on his seat and
                            looked at the steppe.</p>
