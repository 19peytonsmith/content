                <head>THE PORTSMOUTH MUTINY</head>
                
                    <p>The home newspapers to hand this morning furnish us with full details of the most unfortunate 
                        and, at first sight, disturbing incident at Portsmouth which was reported by telegraph. On 
                        Sunday evening, after a merciless autumn day, a large number of naval ratings were mustered 
                        on the parade of the Naval Barracks, as usual, and while waiting, apparently for the 
                        inspecting officer, a rain
                    </p>
                    <p>squall swept over the ground and the men broke ranks and ran for shelter. They were subsequently 
                        directed to reassemble in the ymnasium, and there some 
                        remarks were addressed to them, and all but a body of about three hundred stokers were dismissed.
                    </p>
                    <p>It has been suggested that reflections had been expressed by some of those men which were
                        inimical to discipline. At any rate, they were singled out for (detention, and then some 
                        in the front rank, if not the whole body—the facts are not quite clear—were told to kneel.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is suggested that this was done because the officer wanted to see the men better. At any rate,
                        the order was given at a moment when probably the relations between the officer and the men lacked
                        that cordiality which, we are thankful to say, usually binds the Navy together, and renders it the 
                        magnificent machine that it undoubtedly is. The men seem to have considered the command an act of 
                        subjection, although quite probably no such idea had been entertained when the order was given. 
                        The “knee drill,’’ as the Sal-vationista style it, was, at any rate, carried out by all except two 
                        men, one of whom, it is said, declared that he would kneel to no man. Later in the evening, in the 
                        canteen, these men nursed their grievance until their feelings got the better of them. Then they set 
                        off for the gates, intending, it is said, to attack the quarters of the officer concerned. Happily,
                        news of their over-excitement had been noised abroad, and the guard prevented their carrying out 
                        their mission. Before any further  trouble had occurred, Commodore the Hon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        W.G. Stopford arrived on the scene, and by the exhibition of reasonableness and tact quelled the
                        disturbance. There the story remains at present. The incident, says the “Daily Telegraph," is 
                        greatly to be regretted because it may be thought to reflect on the whole Fleet and to indicate
                        lack of discipline, whereas it seems to be a tale of short temper, and short-shrift on one or on
                        both sides. Of course, it must be remjem-bered./that stokers are not of the same disciplined 
                        character as naval seamen. The latter enter as boys br youths, and learn at a malleable age 
                        to observe the necessarily exacting rules of the service. Stokers, who come in large measure
                        from the North -country engineering establishments, where a certain measure of “independence"
                        is acquired, join the Navy after they have passed impressionable years, and when their characters
                        are formed. This is a most vital difference, and in view of this fact the morale of the stoker 
                        ratings when treated with tact is all the more praiseworthy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Such occurances as that at Portsmouth on Sunday evening are, fortunately, infrequent . we can 
                        recall no parallel in the recent history of the British Navy. Probably all who were Concerned 
                        in the emeute are already heartily _ ashamed of their action. In a country which is democratic
                        in its institutions and sentiments, the task of commanding large bodies of men is one of extreme
                        difficulty. It becomes more and more essential that officers of the fighting Services should exhibit
                        facility for command which is baaed on personal respect rather than on the power of punishment which
                        is at hand, to enforce an order in the last resort. Fortunately the Fleet has never remained a larger
                        body of officers endowed with this priceless qualification.

                    <p>Abd el Hamid Bey Abiza writes "Al Moayad" as follows: After my return from
                    Milan, where I attended the recent exhibition, I submitted to the British Agency in Cairo
                    some notes regarding the Egyptian section of the exhibition, which was the worst
                    on show... it contaied disgraceful exhibits, which would do great harm to the
                    reputation of Egypt. Lord Cromer was then absent in London, but his secretary, Mr. Boyle,
                    submitted my notes to his lordship with some remarks added by himself. On receipt of the
                    document Lord Cromer gave special attention to the matter, and put himself in 
                    communication with the Italian Ambassador in London, with a view to preventing further
                    such exhibitions in the name of Egypt. The results of his Lordship's communication
                    to the Italian Ambassador were that the Italian Government promised to prohibit any exhibition
                    to be labelled "Egyptian" without the consent of the Egyptian Government. Lord Cromer,
                    on the other hand, promised that the Egyptian Government would hence-forth undertake the 
                    organisation of the Egyptian section in any international show.</p>

                    and Dongola, not only testify to Macauley Bey's high professional qualifications, but also to the thouroughness
                    and excellence of his work. The Sirdar on behalf of the Egyptian Army wishes to express his regret at the retirement from

                    <p>The Globes article on the National University which we reporoduced the other day may be said to demand
                    a reply - not in the form of a verbal protest, but rather a demonstration that Moslem Egypt has some real
                    interest in higher education. We do not ourselves entirely share the fears expressed by our London contemporary
                    that our University may become a hot bed of Pan - Islamic agitation. Our fear is that after a spasmadic effort the 
                    public will relapse into a state of good natured apathy, that subscriptions will dwindle, and interest
                    wane, and that finally the National University scheme will end in failure. In our opinion such a termination
                    will not redound to the credit of the Egyptians. They have had an excellent chance of showing that the claims of their
                    journalistic representatives were well founded; that higher education was ardently desired by the young intelligence of 
                    the country, that rich and poor were ready to contribute to the scheme; that the neglect of higher education by the Ministry
                    of Public Instruction was resented by all the 'best elements' of the population.</p>
                    <p> We cannot disguise the fact that the scheme is not meeting with the support that it deserves, and that the unreadiness
                    of Moslem Egypt to contribute thereto is the best defence the Government can possibly offer to any of the criticisms that have
                    so plentifully occupied the contributors to the Native Press. If this neglect and apathy persist, what will become of the impassioned
                    pleading of Mastapha Kamel, of the daily diatribes against Mr. Dunlop, of the communications
                    to the British Press? May it not be possible that the Egyptian Government has throughout taken a saner
                    view of the possibiliteis of higher education in Egypt than many of its self-appointed
                    critis? We do not wish to "crab" the scheme, but we should like to have some evidence that it is going to meet
                    with the support of a public that was represented by orators and journalists as gasping for a deep draught for the
                    Pierian Spring.</p>

                    crossing to Stamboul to venerate the relics of the Prophet, the most extraordinary precautions were taken. All steamers from the Black
                    Sea and Mediterranean were stopped at the entrance to the Bosphorus or the Dardanelles, and all traffic and work on the ships was suspended.
                    The harbour, which is usually thronged with the boats and the shipping, was cleared of everything, and all lighters, caiques, and boats were
                    sent behind the bridges of the Golden Horn, and the entrance was blocked. Only police boats were left. In spite of the above precautions, a Greek
                    steamer attempted to enter the harbour, and when she was stopped by the police, tried to turn, but got caught in a current, which carried her right on 
                    to the Sultan's private landing-stage on Seraglio Point, which she only escaped destroying by letting go her anchors.</p>

                    the methods of certain American journals - Captian Jorge Nelken y Waldberg whose recent appearance in H.B.M's Consular Court at Cairo 
                    was attended by many remarkable incidents. </p>
                    <p> Captain Waldber is the editor and proprietor of "The Oriental Truth," which is the only American daily newspaper published in the 
                    Levant, and is an interesting example of the Yellow Press of the United States transplanted to the banks of the Nile. As gurantee of its 
                    character, Captian Waldberg's organ is printed on paper of an obtrusively yellow character; in fact, its tinge is identical with the 
                    quarantine colours. It is printed in French and Arabic, and was originally only issued weekly and illustrated with ribald cartoond and 
                    faulty photos.</p>

                 <div type="item"> <head type="sub">His Early Career</head>
                    <p> The Captain arrived in Egypt about a year ago from Constantinople. He is, so he says, of Latin-American origin, and we believe his father
                    was an Austrian. He adopted a militaty career some years ago, and served in the army of the South American Republics, whence he obtained his
                    rank of Captain. Subsequently he went northwards to the United States and embarked on a journalistic career. He was an ardent advocate of the 
                    Democratic platform, and had a paper of his own at New York. He next appears as a newspaper correspondant in Central America, where he claims to 
                    have taken the only photpgraph of the newly formed Panama army. Next he transferred his sphere of operations to Europe and joined the American 
                    contingent in the Hellenic-Turkish war. At Athens he married the daughter of a Greek colonel, by whom he has issue. From Greece he went to Constantinople.

                 <div type="item"> <head type="sub">His Stamboul Career</head>
                    <p>He took up his residence in the Capital of the Ottoman Empire in the attic of a boarding house opposite the Maison Olivo, now occupied by the American
                    Embassy. He first started various schemes of a journalistic nature, but these failing, he began the compilation of a biographical album, entitles "Le Corps 
                    Diplomatique et Personnages en Orient." He first subscriber was the Hon. John G. A. Leishman, the American Ambassador, from whom he recieved 25 with the 
                    Ambassadorial signature. This was the first step in the ladder of his subsequent career, for, fortified with this patronage, he approached the other members of
                    the Diplomatic Corps. The Ecumenical Patriarch, among others, refused point blank to subscribe, whereupon the Captain went to the Bulgarian in Exarch, who, being
                    informed of the Patriarchal parsimony, was only too delighted to show his generosity against the meanness of his hated rival. To show his gratitude the Captain, 
                    whose child had been baptized by the Greek Church, had his progeny re-baptized by the "Schismatical" Bulgarian,fortified by this high ecclesiastial patronage,
                    he had moved from his humble room in the second rate boarding house to the Grand Hotel Kroecker. He engaged the services of an Albanian Clerk, Phillip Nogga by name,
                    who had been secretary to the Grand Vizier, Ferid Pasha. The services of this clerk proved of great value. His previous official position had made him adept in all the
                    wiles of intrigues that ever surrounds Yildiz. His knowledge of the previous methods of "backstairs" diplomacy was extensive and peculiar. All the past reputations os
                    the men who basked for the time being the Sultan's fabour, together with the characters of their hangers-on, were known to him to a nicety. He was, in a word, a walking 
                    encyclopedia of the inner history of Yildiz. A recent writer on the Near East remarked "If anybody could put on paper a thoughtful account of one month;s doings at Yildiz,
                    the book would be worth one thousand pounds - take any month in the year. That small circumference of two or three square miles on the top of the hill above Ortakeni and Beshiktash
                    contains more antiquity, probably, than any area ten times as great on the surface of the globe. And the consequences of what goes on so quietly in those shaded gardens and
                    kiosques influence the whole oivilised and more than half of the barbarian world." It is easy to imagine what a treasure trove Phillip Nogga the Albanian was to Captain Waldberg. He
                    knew every track through the monstrous undergrowth of intrigue and corruption which surrounds the decaying fabric of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

                    on the carcass of an Empire in its death agony, began to be seriously disturbed at the prospect of the impending publication of Captian Waldberg's great work.</p>
                    <p>The Captain was most pertinacious in canvassing, but he was not recieved with open arms by all the Ambassadors. Some diplomatists simply referred him for the details he declared he desired
                    to the official facts in their respective Foreign Office Lists, while others indefinitely postponed their decision. With the ecclesisastical bigwigs of Stamboul his success was more marked.
                    The Armenian Patriarch, Ormanian, the Bulgarian Exarch, and other high pontiffs were pleased to lend their patronage. But his great friend and supporter was the Envoy of the King of Kings, General
                    Messeschia, the envoy of the Negus, to whom the captain disposed of a sewing machine and other useful produts of Occidental civilization.</p>
                    <p>The General on his return to Abyssinia procured for the Captian a decoration and an autograph letter from the Negus. Meanwhile the great work was progressing and the Captian became 
                    more prosperous. The Sultan's American A D.C. Captain Bucknam gave it his patronage, and soon a notice announcing the forthcoming book was inserted "Levant Herald."</p>

                    <p>Having thus attained a certain degree of notoriety, the Captain now directed his attention to the great personagee in the immediate entourage of the Sultan. The Sheikh al Islam, Hashem Pasha,
                    the Minister of Public Instruction, and other high functionairies, civil and military, were now approached and gave their biographies, which were to be printed both in French and Turkish. At this
                    juncture his Imperial Majesty stepped in. Whether it was only suspicion, or whether one or other of his courtiers, objected to their biographies appearing cannot be stated with any certainty, but the
                    fact remains with the Imperial Fiat went forth and the great work was suddenly and mysteriously stopped</p>

                 <div type="item"> <head type="sub">Diplomatic Action</head>
                    <p>The Captian declared that this action on the part of the Sultan abuse of autocracy, and as a free and independent citisen of the United Stated he would never submit to such treatment. The American
                    Ambassador was appealed to, and with success, communications passed between Yildiz and the Embassy, and it was finally agreed that a handsome compensation
                    should be given to the agrieved author, whose susceptabilities were soothed by a handsome solatium that went into four figures. His last days at Constantinople were spent in luxury at the Pera Palace Hotel, and 
                    then the Captain set sail to seek fresh fields and pastures new in the land of Egypt.</p>

                 <div type="item"> <head type="sub">Conclusion</head>
                    <p>Captian Waldberg is to be condoled with in his failure in Egypt. He has arrived too late. Had he only appeared in Cairy during the Palmy days of the Ismailian Khediviate he would have had the most roseate prospects
                    of a short but lucrative career, and might easily have recieved a fat pension on the condition of his withdrawal from the country. But times have changed, and there is very little scope nowadays for gentlemen of 
                    his stamp. The best arena for his talents would be some umbrageous little Republic in South or Central America, although it is said that journalists of his type are not unknown to wax prosperous in some Native States in
                    India, but for this we cannot vouch. At any rate, Egypt is clearly not the country for him, and we fear that there is very little chance of "The Oriental Truth" developing into a paying newspaper property. But -happy thought-
                    there is still a chance for him here. Why does he not get Mr. Wilfrid Blunt to take up his case as another "Atrocity of Justice Under British Administration in Egypt."

                    <p>The Attarin Native Court sentenced Mohamed Hassan Nigazi, of Esbet El-Kom, near Damanhouran, on Saturday to 15 years imprisonment with hard labor for the murder of Ibrahim Ahmed el-Raye, of the same esbet, of the 1st September last;
                    and sentenced the murderers accomplice, Mohamed Sayid Hashish by name, to 10 years' imprisonment with hard labor.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning, the same court sentenced Mohamed Ahmed el-Dibali and Khamis el Shishi, of Kom el Kanatir, near Abou Homos, to 7 and 3 years imprisonment with hard labor, respectively, for cattle stealing, and Ali Hassan el Gammal, of Shemasth
                    near Rosetta, to 10 years' hard labor for attempting to steal cattle and seriously assaulting two native women.</p>
                    <p>Kharalambo Kornio, a "rayeh" of Alexandria, was also sentenced on Saturday to 3 years' imprisonment for attempted murder.</p>

                    <p>The wrestling on Saturday night was quite intersting. M. Paul Pons, the huge Frenchman, vanquished M. Limousin, his weight and strength proving far too much for his opponent, who, hoewver, made a fine struggle and showed great activity.
                    Mr. Cilis English (sic), conquered M.Finisch, Swiss, after a short and lively bout. M. Finisch seemed to accept the result as quite usual and part of the day's work, as his usual luck! Nielo, the Italian, beat Sandorfi, the Hungarian, also after a good 
                    enough fight. The last and greatest event of the evening was the fight to a finish between Van de Berg, the Dutchman, and Schackman, the "terrible" German. Scackmann's method did not at all appeal to the audience, nor, we must confess, to ourselves. If he did 
                    not actually foul repeatedly, he was at any rate very near, and we think he should have been severely cautioned at the first sign of offending. Anyhow, he won after some 35 minutes. Van de Berg made a splendid fight of it, and time after time recovered when defeat seemed 
                    inevitable. He showed very great strength of arm, and more than once prevented the German from performing his favorite trick of turning over and on to his feet; but the strength and weight of the other was too much for him, and he seemed quite exhausted at the finish.
