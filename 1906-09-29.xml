                    <head>GERMANY’S BETE NOIRE.</head>
                    <p>A frank statement of the views of the
                    merchant princes of Germany respecting the
                    foreign policy of their country would certainly
                    be of great interest and importance not only
                    for France, but for England. M. Henri de
                    Noussanne, of the “Echo de Paris," who is
                    now making a tour through Northern Europe 
                    and Scandinavia, gives particulars of
                    such a statement made to him at Hamburg
                    by a “personage who has great interests
                    involved in German maritime affairs, and
                    who is not unknown to the Emperor William
                    II, and his principal collaborators, nor
                    to several notabilities of the French commercial 
                    and financial world." It is of interest, 
                    says the "Times” Paris correspondent, as
                    a fresh manifestation of the desire of Germany 
                    to detach France from England and
                    to secure her own hegemony, at least in the
                    economic sphere.</p>
                    
                    <p>This Hamburg shipping magnate, who regards 
                    politics as a matter of business, desired 
                    to speak plainly as a business man.
                    Referring to the manner in which Germany
                    has treated France for the past 36 years,
                    he said that she had naturally taken advantage 
                    of the situation which she created, and
                    would continue to do so. The Germans did
                    not, however, propose to carry out their
                    national programme by war. As to the Pan-
                    Germans, every country had its Chauvinists.
                    The programme of the business men was
                    to live in peace, to produce a large quantity
                    at merchandise, and to be strong enough
                    to trade freely everywhere. In reply to the
                    objection that the economic struggle and the
                    excessive growth of population necessarily
                    led to conflicts, and to a reminder as to
                    the Kaiser’s speeches, the Hamburg magnate
                    said "We regard our Emperor as our best
                    commercial traveller. In reality he has no
                    more desire for war than I have. All our
                    money is invested in business. All our credits 
                    are inextricably bound up together. We
                    lack reserves. If a war were to break out
                    between Germany and England, 50 per cent.
                    of the Hamburg Arms would suspend payment 
                    within 34 hours." To the objection that
                    such considerations would not weigh with
                    the military party, the reply was that the
                    latter was the servant and not the master
                    of the country.</p>
                    
                   <p> As to the possibility that a conflict might
                    occur independently of the will of Germany,
                    this German authority said : - "In any case, it
                    is not France that we have in view. All she
                    has to do is to keep quiet. We do not under-
                    stand how she can play the game of England.
                    After all, it is not so long since Fashoda.”</p>
                    
                    <p>In reply to the retort that the Rhine was,
                    after all, nearer than the Sudan, the Hamburg
                    shipping magnate turned the conversation to
                    France's neglect at her naval and maritime interests. 
                    Frenchmen, he said, should not reproach 
                    Germany with having profited by their
                    own neglect The Germans devoted themselves
                    to trade, while the French preferred banking.
                    "So be It,” he added, "but let each of us under
                    stand our parts and not quarrel. Let us, on
                    the contrary, come to an understanding</p>
                    
                    <p>Being reminded that something more than
                    (air words was required for an understanding,
                    particularly after a threat of war had been
                    followed by the Emperor’s visit to Tangier, the
                    German merchant exclaimed —"Tangier ! always 
                    Tangier! But how can you pretend to
                    prevent us from seeking a position in the Mediterranean
                    when we send on an average every
                    year 250 ships and a million tons of goods more
                    than you yourselves through the Suez Canal,
                    which is nevertheless within a stone's throw
                    of Marseilles. He added that the Germans
                    did not seek to conquer, but merely to assure
                    freedom for their trade. He repeated a statement
                    made by the Kaiser recently in presence
                    of Herr Ballin, director of the Hamburg American
                    Line, and himself respecting France: “A
                    country which has the finest coasts in Europe
                    and not a single free port, a navy and no merchant,
                    marine, colonies and no colonists or emigrants
                    other than officials, and who yet remains
                    indifferent to this state of affairs is abandoned by
                    God, as He must have stricken it with blindness
                    if it does not recognise that it is on the way to
                    ruin." This was repeated by the Hamburg
                    magnate, not in order to offend his French
                    hearer, but merely to show him that the future
                    at France, like that of Germany, was on the
                    sea, and that if France, like Belgium, had
                    marched hand in hand with the German
                    Empire her present condition would be more
                    calm and prosperous and her fortune more
                    secure. As it is, France, he said, has not
                    sufficient soldiers or valuable alliances to
                    defend a treasure which might be destroyed
                    in a moment by a victorious enemy who would
                    impose an indemnity at war.</p>
                    
                    <p>M. de Noussanne gives the moral of the
                    whole interview in a saying which he affirms is
                    current in private among German diplomatists
                    —“the peace of the world can only be secured
                    at the cost of England.”</p>

                in the Mahmoudieh Canal near Ramleh last
                Wednesday. From a cross tattooed on her 
                wrist the girl is believed to have been of Cop
                tie origin. The post mortem examination showed 
                that the body had been for some time in
                the water and evidently came from some
                distance. No clue to the victim's identity has
                as yet been found.</p>

                members to form a quorum. There is no
                important business, however, for discussion.
                The chief subject for discussion, besides some
                credits, are the abuse of cycles, using hooters
                and the question of enforcing the use of a
                covering for carts conveying lime and such
                like dusty materials through the public streets.</p>
                
               <p> Old Fayoum Willia.
                The official correspondence in  Messrs Grenfell
                Hunt’s new work on the Hibeh Papyri
                offers new light on many points interest,
                especially as regards the Fayoum. It has been
                doubted, ever since the publication of the wills
                of the military landholders of the Fayoum is
                the Petris papyri, whether the owners had any
                right of leaving their land by will to their
                heirs. It new appears that upon the death of
                any landholder of this kind (cleruoh) the State
                resumed his land into the Basilikon or Crown
                property. The curious point is that the lot
                kept the name of its former owner, and was
                known by it permanently. This recalls the three
                sections of the Fayoum which were permanently
                known by the names of three men, probably
                their first governors -Herselides,Polemo, and
                Themistes.</p>
                
               <p> “The Cult of a Foreign Race.”
                As Mr Wilfrid Bloat has again come before
                the Egyptian public, it is worth while recalling
                a passage in Mr Edward Dlcey’s “The Story
                of the Khedivate,” which contains some very
                pointed remarks about that gentleman
                “When” he says, “our countrymen go in for
                what I may call the ‘cult’ of a foreign race
                or creed, they always remind one of the
                amateur who, when he acted the Moor
                of Venice, thought it necessary to black himself 
                all over, from the soles of his feet to the tip
                of his forehead. I could never take Mr. Blunt’s
                Orientalist seriously, after I found out that,
                in order to sustain his character as a denizen
                of the East, he used, en arrival at Cairo, to
                be met at the station by his camel,and ride
                to Shepherd’s Hotel, a distance of barely
                five minutes’ walk, sooner than take a 
                carriage like a commonplace tourist.”</p>

               <p> MR. BLUNT'S PAMPHLET.
                “Al Mokattam" writes a propos of Mr.
                Blunt's latest critique.</p>
                
               <p> As we have already stated, our opinion
                on Mr. Blunt's latest work absolutely agrees
                with that of our eminent confrere— Mr. Moberly
                Bell of the “Times." We own only repeat
                with him that Mr. Blunt can only succeed
                in encouraging disturbance and disunion.</p>
                
               <p> On the other hand we are glad to state
                that the number of those carried off their feet
                by Mr Blunt’s fallacies is extremely small,
                but their pens are dipped in gall, their
                tongues are ready, and none are better posted
                in the art of impressing the imagination of
                the public by the ingenious employment of
                appeals to patriotism and religion. Sooner or
                later England will be compelled to put a
                forcible end to a liberty that is become intolerable 
                unless the wiser element- of the
                population can stop the mouths of these
                frenzied patriots. We must therefore grasp
                the full significance of the almost official
                warnings of the “Times” and of the fact
                that British policy is unlikely to be influenced
                by the excited utterances of a few Liberal
                cranks, among whom we reckon Mr. Blunt.
                Finally we must realise once for all that
                our adhesion to a policy of attacks against
                England can only be prejudicial to the interests
                of the whole nation, and that pacific
                claims patiently and temperately urged can
                alone bring about those reforms that can be
                reasonably granted.</p></div>

                their fate,—a long and lovely exile in the

                sent to the chief cities of Europe asking
                that men with special qualifications should be
                recommended for the post of chief engineer.
                Berlin answered that it knew of none suitable

                untiring efforts of Mr. Adolphe Bagdalli, the

               <p> Mme Jane Hadin, the celebrated French
                actress, is to pay a visit to Cairo during the
                coming season and will give a series of representations.
                at the Abbas Theatre. Mme
                Hading is the daughter of an actor, and appeared
                on the stage at a very early age. Her
                first appearances were in the provinces, but at
                the age of seventeen she captivated the somewhat
                critical audiences of the Paris Palais
                Royal, and gained equal successes at the Renaissance
                and Gymnase. She created the 
                famous role of “Sapha,” in Daudet’s play of 
                that name, which has perhaps been made 
                known to most of our theatre-going readers by
                Mme. Olga Nethersole. Another role of note
                which was created by Mme. Hading is that of
                Claire, in the Maitre de Forges (1883). She 
                was married in 1884 to the famous French
                actor Victor Koning, against whom she obtained
                a divorce three years later. She has more
                than once visited London, where she invariably
                received a very heart welcome. The presence
                of so celebrated an actress in Cairo is sure to
                attract enormous crowds, and most serve as an
                encouragement to others to make themselves
                known at the world’s greatest winter resort. </p></div>

                at a distance lees than 350 metres from
                inhabited dwellings. The defendants declared
                that this law did in no way apply to them as its
                object clearly was to stop the danger to passerby
                from promiscious firing and that the systematic
                shooting of pigeons in a carefully enclosed
                space would not be considered as endangering
                the safety of the public in the slightest. The
                defendants also invoked a judgment of the
                Alexandria Mixed Contraventions Court,
                which decided in a similar case, in favour of
                the proprietors of a pigeon shooting arson
                Judgment will be given on Monday.</p></div>

                <head>FOUR MEN SUFFOCATED</head>
                <p>Four natives were suffocated on Wednesday
                morning in a dry well at Cairo, in the Darb
                Sanenate quarter. The master of the small farm on
                which this well is situated, El Hag Hussein
                Ragh by name, told the first of the victims.
                Sourour-el-Abd, to go down into the well for
                purpose which is not known.</p>
                
               <p> A quarter of an hour passed, but he did not
                return, and Hussein Ragh, becoming anxious,
                ordered another of his men, Said, to go
                below, he likewise did not return. The master,
                who was now utterly perplexed at to what
                should detain his men, went down himself
                and he was followed by a Copt eneighbour, a
                jeweller, who had seen the others disappaer
                thus mysteriously. The farmer’s son, who by
                now suspected that something unusual had
                happened, informed the Bab el Shariah Caracol.
                It was however, too late; the four men were
                already dead before help could come, and after
                a postmortem they were buried at two o'clock
                in the afternoon.</p>
                
                <p>Two versions are given to account for this
                subterranean tragedy;—
                One is that Hussein Ragh, had ordered
                Serour to go down to search for a hook used
                for drawing water, and that he bad been, together 
                with the others, asphyxiated by carbonic
                acid gas. Another that he had, to save the cost
                of transport, thrown into the wall the carcase
                of a young buffalo that had died in the stall,
                and that the neighbors fearing noxious exhalations 
                therefore had threatened Hussein, with
                legal proceedings if he did not have the carcases
                removed. It was the gas produced by the
                decomposition of the carcass, which, according
                to this version, has been the cause of death.
                The results of the police inquiry are not yet
                known.</p></div>

                <p>Major J. H. L'Estrange Johnstone, General
                Manager of the Egyptian Railways, is deed.
                (Reuter)</p>
                
                <p>Major James H. L'Estrange Johnstone, M.V.O.
                was born at Alva, Scotland, on the 8th
                of August 1865 end was the eon of the late
                James Johnstone and grandson of Lieut.-Col.
                H. P. l’Estrange of Moyston, Ireland. He
                received his early education at Eton, from
                where he passed into the Woolwich Military
                Academy, and he afterwards studied at the
                School of Military Engineering, Chatham. He
                entered the Royal Engineers in 1884 and from
                1886 to 1887 he was a military pupil at Sir
                Wm. Armstrong, Mitchell and Co.’s works at
                Elawick. In 1888 he was appointed assistant
                engineer of the 1st grade by the Military
                Works Department of India and sent to Aden.
                From 1880 to 1891 he was inspecting officer
                of the Royal Engineers' Machinery at Malta
                and the following year he was temporarily
                employed on the preservation of Abu-Simbel
                temple by the Ministry of Public Works. From
                1894 to 1899 he was inspector of iron
                structures and railways at the War Office
                headquarters and he left that post to become
                President of the Egyptien State Railways. He
                was made a member of the Royal Victorian
                Order (4th class) in 1902, and in the following
                year Grand Officer of the Imperial Ottoman
                Order of the Osmanieh. Major Johnstone
                married Amy Octavia, daughter of Andrew
                Wauchope in 1901.</p>
                
                <p>No details of the circumstances which led
                to the Major's death had been received at the
                headquarters of the Egyptian Government
                Railways at Cairo, up to the time of our going
                to Press. His death was entirely unexpected
                and he was expected to return to Cairo from
                Europe at the beginning of next week. Major
                Johnstone was a man of considerable Intellectual
                ability and passed first out of Woolwich.
                Although he cannot be said to have been
                a railway administrator of the first rank, he
                was an energetic and conscientious worker and
                did his best in trying to introduce some
                efficiency into the Egyptian Government Railways.
                That he succeeded to a large degree is
                evidenced by the improved condition of the
                administration today.</p>
                
                <p>(By Telephone).
                Cairo, 1.30 p.m.</p>
                
               <p> When the news first reached Cairo this morning 
                it was at first surmised that the announcement
                referred to one of the Major’s eons, as up
                to only a few day ago letters received from him
                contained no intimation that he was in anything 
                but the best of health. But the news
                has been confirmed by a telegram, which
                passed through Cairo this morning to Sir John
                Herrington, the British Minister at Adis
                Abebs, begging him to break the news of the
                Major’s death to his brother, who is at present
                at Shoa in Abyssinia.</p>
                
               <p> It is presumed that death was due to some
                accident. At far as is at present known, the
                Major expired in Switzerland.</p></div>

                <head>RAMLEH WATER SUPPLY.</head>
                <head>A VITAL QUESTION</head>
               <p> A question of the utmost importance for the
                well being of Alexandria's delightful Eastern
                suburbs, known under the collective name of
                Ramleh, is that of the supply of filtered water
                to the houses. The main water pipes have now
                been laid down, and the Alexandria Municipality 
                contributed three quarters of the cost of
                this installation. The balance was paid by the
                Alexandria Water Company. The mains are
                ready and everything is, in fact, complete for
                in Ramleh. But as is usually the case in
                Egypt, after a great effort is made, the responsible
                authorities think themselves entitled to a
                little repose and the result is that no water
                comes. We here been asked by some of our
                readers, who live is Ramleh, the reason of this
                inscrutable delay. As is generally the case in
                Alexandria, the fault is popularly supposed to
                lie with the Municipality, which is the scapegoat
                of the ignorant,but although we are by no
                means prone to always acquit it of indifference
                to the public weal, we must allow that is this
                instance it is entirely absolved. The sole obligation
                of the Municipality in this case was to
                supply three-quaters of the money for the
                main pipes. But the duty of making the filtered
                water supply of Ramleh of practicable utility
                rested with the Water Company. How is it
                that the Company has up to now refrained
                from fulfiliing this essential obligation? It is
                to be hoped that the Board of Directors will
                soon take steps to satisfy the Ramleh public,
                for the work of connecting the main conducts
                with the houses rests solely with them.</p></div>

                <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”
                Sir, - With reference to the “Lewa’s 
                charges of “cowardice and low birth” against
                the Syrians in consequence of the recent
                mutiny at Port Said as referred to in your
                columns on the 27th instant, this is certainly
                amusing as coming from such a source, when
                we well remember that Ali Effendi Fahey
                (now Ali Bay) the brother of his Excellency
                Mustafa Pasha Kamel and probably the
                writer of the article is the “gentleman” who
                as an officer of the Egyptian Army was tried
                by a General Court Martial by order of Lord
                Kitchener, at Abbassia in the spring on 1896
                and convicted on a charge of cowardice.
                “Dismissed from his Highness’ service as
                “an officer, and held to serve as a conscript”
                “private soldier.”</p>
                
                <p>After the promulgation of the proceedings
                of the Court Martial, he was posted to the 
                7th Egyptian Battalion, with which he served
                in laying the Sarras-Kums railway during the
                Dongala expedition.</p>
                
               <p> The “particulars” of the charge on which he
                was convicted were that when orders were 
                issued for the Egyptian Army to proceed on
                active service, he, through cowardice, tendered
                the resignation of his commission in order to
                avoid proceeding on active service. The
                Syrians did not rejoice over his downfall.-</p>

                <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”
                Sir.-The correspondence upon the above
                subject in your valuable paper led me to refer
                to your summary of H.E. Saba Pasha’s Report
                for 1905m in which I find that 4,300,000 letters
                were dispatched in that year to Great Britain,
                Malta, and Gibraltar alone. Taking the most
                moderate estimate of half an ounce weight per
                letter, there was, then, a discrimination of
                4,479 3s. 4d. as against this country. This
                figure would no doubt be enormously swelled
                if the dispatch of letters to other places which
                have a convention for reduction of letter
                postage with Egypt were included, even when
                leaving out of account the probability that
                thousands of the letters weighed more than
                half an ounce. But that is not all. The figures
                I have taken—the latest available—relate to a
                period before the reduction of rates was put in
                force. That the number of letters sent from
                this country has increased by one half at least
                in consequence of such reduction is a legitimate
                inference from the increase which have
                taken place by reason of such reduction in
                other parts of the world.</p>
                
                <p>It would seem pairing strange in any other
                country which has to any extent adopted
                Western methods that the Post Office Report
                for 1905 should have taken nearly ten months
                in preparation. Chi va piano va sand is a very
                good old adage, but is quite inapplicable in
                the instance under consideration. At the present
                rate of progress, we shall have to wait
                another year before we are able to calculate
                approximately the excess rate which is still
                being charged. I hope with another correspondent
                of yours that someone in our British

                <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”
                Sir,—I notice a letter in yesterday’s issue
                of the “Egyptian Gazette” signed "Bobby" on
                the want of a Caracol at Kasr el Nil. Surely
                a Caracol is far more wanted in the Kasr el
                Doubara quarter! In case of any trouble, it
                is here that the British Agent and the G.O.C.
                of the Army of Occupation live and yet in
                view of the Pan Islamic unrest they have no
                protection. Truly yours</p>

            <head>ADDRESS TO LORD MILNER</head>
            <p>BRITISH ANTI-NATIONALISM.</p>
            <p>London, September 28</p>
           <p> Lord Milner, receiving an address from
            25,000 Cape Colonists praising his services,
            said that the danger in South Africa was
            disunion but that a far greater danger was the
            growth of the spirit of anti nationalism in
            Great Britain, owing to which South Africa
            was the special sufferer. Anti-nationalism was
            a great growing factor threatenirn every part
            of the Empire, but once Great Britain awoke
            to the strength which it has acquired she
            would unite in a tremendous rally to preserve
            the Empire.	(Reuter)</p></div>

                <p>The tendency in the home army just now
                is to Withdraw more gunmen from the forte to
                form more heavy Field Batteries. The 10
                pounder gun, with which the heavy batteries
                are armed isae very fine weapon, of great
                range and penetration, and its usefulness was
                fully demonstrated in the most recent maneuvers.
                Of course it is a bit ponderous, but when well
                horsed can move with wonderful celerity.
                Within the past few weeks boards of officers
                have visited various places in England and

                <p>A special Army Order just promulgated
                ordains that no officer shall be considered
                eligible for the command of a regiment of
                cavalry, or a battalion of infantry, unless he
                has returned to regimental duty at least twelve 
                months immediately before the vacancy occurs, 
                except in cases where the vacancy is caused by
                unforeseen circumstances. A captain, after at
                least six years service, and a major or lieutenant
                colonel may be promoted to the next
                highest rank by brevet for distinguished service
                in the field. It is further ruled that an officer
                may draw full pay whilst on sick leave for the
                following periods - (1), ordinary cases for
                a period not exceeding 12 months. (2)- In
                very special cases, such as the loss of health
                due to tropical service, or active operations,
                the period may be extended, but it shall not
                exceed 12 months in all.</p>
                
                <p>The War office has rated that a captain
                or major employed under the Egyptian Government
                shall be removed from his regiment
                and placed on half pay if he is continued
                in such employment for more than ten years,
                or beyond the date on which he would
                ordinarily have to return to regimental employment
                in order to qualify for commend. Some

                sediment from them. At nights I would have
                to leave the bed many times. I have been

                I began with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.

                PITH OF THE PRESS.
                Church and State In France.
                Plus X., we are assured, is convinced that
                the French Government is bent on gradually
                dechristianising France, and that the Separation
                is a conscious movement in this
                direction. M des Hoax and his liberal
                Catholic friends, on the other hand, see
                “Germano Roman manoeuvres" everywhere in
                the recent development of Papal policy. There
                may be, and no doubt there is, an element of
                foundat on for these suspicions on either aide
                - though, so far as the French Government is
                concerned, M. Briand, the author of the
                Separation Law, has categorically denied any
                such designs as those attributed to it by the
                Pope. But it is impossible not to feel that too
                elaborate apprehensive of this kind only breed
                fresh distrust and misunderstanding, and in
                the Pope's ease may launch the Church on a
                course far more disastrous to its interests than
                a simple acceptance of the Separation Law
                would appear to us to be. ("Times.")
                
                “Rulers of the Waves."
                Since - Britain first at Heaven's command
                Arose from out the azure main," she has
                never on one day committed to the charge
                of the sea three such huge vessels as those
                which were launched yesterday at Wallsend-on-Tyne,
                Belfast, and Chatham respectively.
                Two of these monsters of the deep are to be
                devoted to the peaceful and pacifying business
                of trade and passenger traffic, though the
                Mauretania will also be a sort of citizen soldier
                of the seas, being armed and adapted as a
                scout or cruiser, while the speed of the Shannon 
                will enable her to act as the natural
                protector, in time of war, of the vast merchant
                shipping for which swiftness is less important
                than economical transport of cargo.
                
                The simultaneous launch of there
                mighty ships, though the simultaneity was
                quite undesigned, proves that we can turn
                out from these shores at the shortest possible
                notice more formidable vessels than any of
                our maritime rivals. Nothing can wrest from
                Great Britain the “command of the sea" save
                the supineness of our rulers and the indifference
                of our people. There is a great deal
                of nonsense talked about “militarism,” but
                happily no one has yet discovered that "navalism”
                is a possible form of national disease.
                Even the "Little England” has come to
                recognise that "Little England” would not be
                safe were there no powerful Fleet to defend
                its not inacessible shores (“Telegraph.”)
                
                Britain and Turkish Import Outlet.
                We are glad to see, from the Constantinople
                telegrams, that Sir Edward Grey is not yet
                prepared to sanction the increase of the Turkish
                import duties from 8 to 11 per cent. English
                diplomacy has rarely had in its hands a more
                useful weapon than this,and it would be deplorable
                if our assert were given without obtaining
                some very considerable concessions in return.
                Our trade still accounts for 69 per cent of the
                whole imports affected, and we have therefore
                every right to sell our assent dear. It is quite
                proper, we think, since our trade must suffer
                somewhat by the increase, that the opportunity
                should be seised of settling such outstanding
                commercial grievances as those of the British
                Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company.
                
                To a great extent, also, we share the fears
                of Mr Lynch and other Bagdad merchants,
                who think that if this fresh revenue is granted
                to Turkey, even under the stipulation that its
                proceeds are to go to the relief of the Macedonian
                Budget, it will provide a basis on which
                capital could be raised to finance the German
                Bagdad Railway. We are by no means hostile
                in principle to that railway, but we should not
                like to see it financed this obscure and
                furtive way , before the capital is provided for
                it, England ought to be in a position to safeguard
                the interests which she has at stake in
                Mesopotamia and the Persaen Gulf. (“Tribune.”)
                
                
                Our Navy's Pressing Needs.
                Our unchallenged predominance at sea has
                owed much to the fact that our wealth allowed
