THE RUSSIAN FLEET.
The embarrassment caused by the presenoe
of the Baltic Squadron in the Far Eastern
waters shows few signs of diminution, and
tho news which we receive to-day from
Tokio is not likely to allay the tension which
undoubtedly prevails. “It is positively affirm
ed (says Renter) that the Baltic Fleet left
Honkohe temporarily under French pressure,
but it has alone returned and remains there."
It is perfectly obvious therefore that France
has disregarded the strong protest from Tokio
and continues to give asylum to the fleet of
her ally. The semi-official vindication of the
French attitude which was published last weak
cannot be described as a very convincing doon-
ment. It is directed against the censored
message" from Hong Kong, the appearance
of which caused so grave an impression, and for
the first time made us realise how grave were
the breaches of neutrality that had ooourred.
The “dementi" somewhat baldly asserts that
not only has the French Government not been
at tanlt as regards the rules of neutrality, “but,
after having sent to its agents, both civil and
military, very precise instructions for the
application of those rules, it has not oeased to
direct its efforts to their execution.” Reply-
ing to M. de Pressens4 in the French Cham-
ber yesterday, M. Rouvier declared that
he had nothing to add to the previous expla-
nations ; “he could only repeat that he had
ordered the authorities in the Far Eiat to sec
that neutrality was strictly observed.’' Nothing
could be more vague or general, especially
when the minute particulars given by LkffanV
correspondent are remembered. He asserted
from hi* own personal observation made on a
That no such untoward incident has yet
taken place is due to various causes. We be-
lieve Japan to be sincerely reluctant to enlarge
the sphere of operations and to bring about
what would inevitably be a very delicate
situation between Great Britain and Franoe.
And Japan farther recognises the extreme
embarrassment of the position into which
France has been allowed to drift by her Govern-
ment From want of firmness at the beginning,
and from inability to realise the fall conse-
qnenoee of the laxity shown in her colonial
ports, France is now between two fires; between
an injured and exasperated Japan and a
Russia which is resolved to push the oom-
plaisancy of her ally to the last extremity.
During the long sojourn of Rodjestvensky at
Nossi Bb, and in the light of the protests of
Japan and the comments of the Anglo-Saxon
Press, the French Government had ample time
to concert a plan of action against the next
appearance of Russian warships in French
territorial waters. Nothing of the kind was
attempted, and the analogy of Madagascar has
been exactly followed at Kamaranh Bay. But
even if France had been more desirous of
discharging her duties as a neutral, the culpable
weakness of the French Navy in the Far East
would have made its difficult task. With the
resources at her disposal it becomes a difficult
matter to prevent abuse of harbours and of
telegraphic stations on French territory.
France has much to learn as to the duties and
responsibilities both of a Colonial Empire and
a neutral Power.</p>
<p>But there is a final reason why Japan has
for tho present refrained from taking the law
into her own hands. She has no wish to play
the Russian game and come down south to
meet the Baltic Fleet. All the moral strategy
at Rodjeetvensky's command is being expended
just now towards that object, and ho is still
counting on being able to force Togo into
making reprisals. And the report of a
mysterious squadron off Labuan, only about
500 miles from the present position of the
Russian Admiral, renders it just possible that
he has induced Togo to detach a portion of
his fleet The objective of the main Russian
force is, m we all know, Vladivostok. To get
there he has the choice of two roads, namely,
either through the Formosa Channel and tho
Teu sima Straits, or east of Formosa and east
of Japan and through the Tau-gara Straits,
which divide the island of Yezo from the main
island of Japan. If he goes by the former, he
will be subjected in narrow waters to constant
attacks by tho Japanese torpedo flotillas, and
along the whole course of his journey north ho
will be harassed and worn down by an enemy
whose constant care is to avoid a fleet aotiori.
If, on the other hand, he ohoosea the eastern
route, he will have no friendly harbour in ease
of disaster, he will be liable to attack, and
those of his ships which fail to make Vladivos-
tok will either be sank or captured. Togo
understands the game, we may be sure, but so
long as Rodjestvensky remains intact in the
neighbourhood of French waters there must
continue to be an amount of very disagreeably</p></div>
