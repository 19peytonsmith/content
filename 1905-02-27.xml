                    <head>The Railway Report.</head>
                    <p>As stated in our columns on Saturday, the report of the Railway Commission on
                        the Egyptian State Railways is given to the public in its entirety. In
                        reviewing this elab= orate and comprehensive report it naturally occurs to
                        us that our railways lend themselves to, and possibly invite, criticism to
                        an extent which would apply to hardly any other Department of State. How
                        some others would have stood the searching ordeal to which the railways have
                        been subjected, we do not venture to guess, and that it would have been
                        possible for any chief or chiefs to have effected the improvements in the
                        railways, which have been carried out, for instance, in the Customs
                        Administration, is another question on which we do not venture to give an
                        opinion ; but it is noteworthy that the opportunity, which has presented
                        itself to the public, does not seem to have been taken advantage of to
                        complain, as would have been in conformity therewith, if they had considered
                        themselves badly served. The work we enter upon is facilitated by our ready
                        acceptance of the commissioners’ report as an outspoken and unvarnished tale
                        given to us in extenso by the authorities. The omission of reference to the
                        personnel becomes Intelligible as we study the report, its subject and its
                        surrounding circumstances, but we do not, for an instant, suppose that the
                        commissioners shirked this part of the duties entrusted to them. The report
                        commences by recapitulating the instructions conveyed to the Commissioners
                        by the Adviser. All that need be said of those is that they were clear and
                        compre- hensive, evidently showing a desire that the work should be
                        thoroughly done and fully reported upon. The appointments to the commission
                        were carefully made with the same objects and, when one considers the varied
                        qualifications and experience of those gentlemen and the reputations they
                        enjoy where they are best known, we are inclined to think better selections
                        could not have been made. On their part the commissioners showed their
                        earnestness in the work by proceeding at once, upon landing, to see things
                        for themselves, and to gain all the information they could. We have it from
                        the report that they inspected every yard of the lines, and, from our own
                        knowledge, that in this town they went over the whole of the railway
                        premises (including Gabhari and its new shuntiug yard), the port, etc,
                        entertained some of our leading merchants to dinner, and spent a morning
                        with our <cb n="6"/> Chamber of Commerce,—not a bad record for two days'
                        work, and we have no reason to believe that they were less energetic
                        elsewhere. It is a great thing to know that the work was thus dealt with,
                        even hurriedly.</p>
                    <p>The first conclusion arrived at by the Com- mission is that the general
                        management of the railways is unsatisfactory, and that this is due to the
                        system in force. Of all things in the world, the immediate charge of a rail-
                        way is admittedly the work of one man; and so it is, everywhere but in
                        Egypt, that the success or failure of a line, or system of lines, is placed
                        to the account of the man in supreme charge. There are those who succeed and
                        draw the high salaries they deserve, and those who have failed and been paid
                        highly to go. In this country we have, instead, a body of three, all of
                        different nationalities and, perhaps more unfortunately still, all
                        exceedingly able men. Apparently their respective duties and powers are as
                        undefined as they are limited by circumstances, and we do not even gather
                        that the Chairman has power of veto or any other special authority. Coupled
                        with this fact, it is within the knowledge of all that the Government and
                        the Caisse de la Dette ex- ercise separate powers, and that all sorts of
                        political reasons, local laws, and customs tend to increase the difficulties
                        of management. We have no desire to defend anybody or anything, but the
                        public have, we think, some reason to be thankful that, instead of a
                        deadlock having been ever arrived at, considerable progress and improvements
                        have of late years been effected. We can all remember when the journey
                        between Alexandria and Cairo was made under very different conditions to
                        those existing at pre- sent. We are glad to see the acknowledgment of the
                        improved punctuality of the passenger train service, and we can add to this
                        ours of the increased comfort and security of travel- ling. The
                        commissioners state that it has been impossible "to work these railways on
                        good commercial lines” and that the conditions are "heart-breaking" to those
                        concerned and int- erested in the work. Close attention to one's duties
                        under such circumstances is much to be admired, and we know of many in their
                        differ- ent positions who are entitled to great praise on this account, as
                        well as to apologies for criticisms which have been unfairly levelled at
                        them.</p>
                    <p>We come now to the remedy: one general manager with the powers be would
                        possess anywhere else. The report does not say if such a man is to be found
                        on the railways, or is to be a new importation. It does not either enter
                        into the question whether such powers can or cannot be given to a single
                        individual (however fit for his position) in this country, or whether, in
                        fact, his duties can be similar to those of a general manager elsewhere,
                        owing to the differ- ence in conditions which must exist between a State
                        railway in this country and an railway in any other. Those are all questions
                        which the commissioners evidently did not consider immediately dominated
                        them or their recommendations for the future, and we cannot say that our
                        view is different, but we can realise that the Government might have liked
                        something easier to solve than a recommendation in terms such as these Above
                        such general manager, a State Council is proposed. The idea is excellent, we
                        even trust it is practicable. The difficulty we foresee is that the members
                        must have some leisure to give to their important though occasional duties
                        and not enough to devote to worrying. the general manager or to submitting
                        to worries from him or caused by him. The commissioners were all men well
                        versed in successful business and company management, and doubtless their
                        model was a good board of directors such as they are accustomed to work
                        with, and holding powers extending to the promotion of the fit and the
                        removal of offenders. Under the general manager there would be the usual
                        departments and the head of each would be responsible for its organisation
                        and working. Given the necessary qualifications in such chiefs, and
                        following on the same lines of giving to all of these the powers and respon-
                        sibilities conferred upon them everywhere but in Egypt, the working of the
                        machinery may be said to be completely and satisfactorily provided for: the
                        rest is mere detail. Of course, even the most able and energetic head of a
                        department cannot do everything himself, and the Egyptians are to be trained
                        for higher posts, so we must take it to mean, that all heads are to be
                        supported by sufficient trained assistants. The fact that salaries are too
                        low has been recognised. Such could not well have escaped the notice of
                        railway men from England, India, and South America. With increased pay
                        (which must be sufficiently general) more laborious duties and more eff-
                        icient performance of them can be exacted, the machine need not be left so
                        much to itself in the hot weather, and there should not be the same number
                        of whole and half holidays. We feel that this is a convenient point at which
                        to bring the present article to a close, and in our next we shall consider
                        the proposals as affecting the different departments.</p>

                    <p>ST. Petersburg February 25 The Japanese attack on Beresneff Hill during the
                        night of the 23rd inst. was repulsed. it was, however, renewed yesterday,
                        when the Russians were forced to retire. A desperate battle is proceeding
                        along the whole front the result being indecisive. General Sakharoff reports
                        that the railway bridge in the vicinity of Hai-Cheng has been blown up, thus
                        interrupting the Japanese communications. (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>TOKIO, February 25. The Russian attempt to blow up the bridge at Haicheng has
                        been foiled by the arrival of Japanese reinforcements. The Russian cavalry
                        is constantly active in the direction of Niu- clwang. (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>ST. Petersburg, February 25. General Sakharoff reports that Beresneff was

                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, February 26. A despatch from General Kropotkin shows that the
                        last day's fighting for the village of Tsinkhechen was most desperate. He
                        reports a series of acts of bravery on the part of the Russians, who did not
                        evacuate the position until their cartridges were exhausted. Their losses
                        are still unknown, but 12 officers and 300 men have been taken to the
                        hospital. The percentage of head is large. The Japanese are advancing on the
                        passes held by the Russians. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <head>Rodjestvensky at Fault</head>
                    <p>Paris, Feburary 25. The text of the Commission's report bears evident signs
                        of compromises. some of the passages are almost Contradictory, thus ac¬
                        counting for the misleading character of the previous anticipations. It says
                        that Admiral Rodjestvensky's permanent orders to open fire “in case of are
                        evident and immediate attack by torpedo-boats" were not excessive in time of
                        war, and particularly in circumstances which the Admiral had reason to
                        believe were alarming, hut the Commissioners find—Russia alone
                        dissenting—there were no torpedo-boats present, at the time of the incident.
                        The responsibility for opening fire and for the results devolves upon
                        Rodjestvensky. The Commissioners believe that the Rus¬ sians neutrally tiled
                        upon their own cruiser "Aurora," which they mistook for a torpedo- boat .
                        The firing anyhow was unduly prolonged. Rodjestvensky ought to have informed
                        the authorities of the occurrence when passing Dover. It concludes by
                        stating that the report is not intended to disparage the capacity or
                        humanity of Rodjestvensky. (Reuter.)</p>

                        way throw discredit on the military valour and the humanitarian sentiments
                        of the Admiral and his squadron. (Havas.)</p>

                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, February 26. The Minister Yermuloff was engaged during the
                        past week in preparing a long and detailed report on the inner situation of
                        Russia. He presented it on Friday to the Tsar. This report, depicting in
                        plain language the chaotic condition of Russia and indicating the danger of
                        procrastination, shows the absolute neces¬ sity, in order to avert a
                        revolution, of adopt¬ ing immediate drastic measures to meet the grave
                        crisis. No reforms short of a Constitu¬ tion on western hues will satisfy
                        the people and restore order. The Tsar has since directed steps to be taken

                        Constitution giving, in a large measure, re¬ presentative government. A

                    <p>COINERS RAIDED.—Miralai Hopkinson Bey and the Alexandria City Police are to
                        be con¬ gratulated on having brought off a highly successful “coup” this
                        morning. For some time past it had been known that a gang of coiners had
                        established themselves in Alexandria, and the police have accordingly been
                        on the look¬ out. At last a raid was made this morning on a house in Karmous
                        and two coiners were found hard at work turning out English sove¬ reigns and
                        floriusand Egyptian dollars. The coining plant was most elaborate, and the
                        various coins were found in the dies and in other stages of manufacture. The
                        two men are Greek local subjects and are believed to have come from
                        Mansourah. The coins were sent to the villages. Some of the coins found this
                        morning were so well made that they have a distinct ring.</p>
                    <p>SUEZ E.T.C.-STAFF MESS “AT HOME." — The visit of the C. S. “Electra” to Suez
                        was the occasion of an “at home” given by the mem- ber's of the E.T.C. Staff
                        Mess on Wednesday last. The function was well attended and dancing was
                        indulged in by the numerous invites.” The quarters had been suitably
                        transformed for the occasion, and the artistic taste exhibited by the
                        members of the mess in the decoration of the rooms would have done credit to
                        many of the fairer sex. After supper the guests were treated to some songs
                        Mr. H. T. Heale’s splendid baritone voice was shown to full advantage in
                        “Nirvana," a song thoroughly appreciated by the listeners, and “My
                        Toreador,” sweetly sung by Mrs. Scott, deserved in every Way the applause it
                        received. The singers were ably accompanied by Mrs. Tillard. Before dancing
                        was resumed Mr. O. D. Harris gave some original im¬ personations of the
                        popular conjurer, juggler, and “strong man" of the London music hall stage.
                        On leaving, the guests were unanimous in their expressions of thanks and
                        enjoyment to the members of the E.T.C. Staff Mess, whose entertainments and
                        hospitality are a feature of life iu Suez</p>

                    <p>The annual general meeting of the members of the A. H. S. will be held
                        to-morrow at 6 p.m. at the offices of Messrs. Carver Bros. and Co., Ltd. In
                        their report to the members, the committee state that the Agricultural
                        Depart¬ ment of the United. States' kindly presented the society with
                        several fruit trees, such as oranges, plums, and peaches, with the object of
                        improving the stock already existing in the country, but although the
                        packing was carefully executed the long sea journey was clearly detrimental
                        to the plants and only two Navel oranges and one Homosassa blood orange have
                        survived. These, however, are healthy plants and it is hoped that, in a year
                        or two, it will be possible to offer members shoots for grafting. The
                        disease that has attacked the orange trees has by no means disappeared ; and
                        the committee understand that besides the oranges and bananas, the figs,
                        grapes and dates also show signs of scale and other parasites which are
                        detrimental to their proper development It is therefore with pleasure that
                        the committee have heard that the Khedivial Agricultural Society has
                        appoint¬ ed an export to study the cause and effect of the different
                        diseases which have appeared in the country. The best proof of the continued
                        popularity of the society's shows is that every year more space is required;
                        Besides the Casino at San Stefano, which was again kindly placed at the
                        disposal of the committee by the Nungovich Hotels Co., it was necessary last
                        spring to add four large tents, being one more than in 1903, and in the
                        autumn the exhibits were found to be too numerous for the ball-room and the
                        cut flowers had consequently to be placed in the large reading-room. Besides
                        two Princes of the Khedivial family there are now 114 members of the
                        society. The accounts for the past year show a balance of P.T. 3,902.5,
                        besides £200 Egyptian Unified Debt deposited at the Bank of Egypt.</p>

                        Adolphus had been surmised in some of the London newspapers, but was
                        categorically denied in “Truth,” which stated that there was a project of
                        marriage between the Prince and Princess Olga of Ha ¬nover, third daughter
                        of the Duke of Cumber¬ land. The Prince was born on November 11, 1882, and
                        is the eldest son of the Crown Prince of Sweden and Norway, and in the

                        Egyptian Press, his Excellency Dr. Haicalis
                        Pasha, Editor-proprietor of the “Phared’Alexan-
                        drie. The Pasha, who had been ill for some
                        weeks, breathed his last yesterday evening at
                        5.50 o clock. The funeral will take place this
                        afternoon at 4 o'clock.
                        Nicolas Haicalis pasha was born at Zante
                        on the 29th May, 1836. He was educated at
                        Athens and afterwards at Turin, where he
                        resided with the family of Count Santa
                        Rosa, who died at Sphacteria fighting for
                        the independence of Greece. He obtained
                        the degree of Doctor of. Law at Turin
                        University and returned in 1860 to Greece,
                        where he joined the Athenian Bar. Before
                        he had begun to practise at the Bar, he
                        made the acquaintance of the manager of the
                        Daira of Prince Ahmed Pasha, and was invited
                        by him to visit Egypt He did so, and was
                        shortly afterwards appointed counsel to the
                        Daira Ahmed Pasha at a salary of L.E. 60 a
                        month. On the Khedive Ismail succeeding to
                        the Viceroyship, Haicalis was appointed counsel to
                        the Azezieh Steam Navigation Company. In
                        this position he initiated a permanent steam¬
                        ship service between the Piraens and Egypt
                        Formerly the direct route from Alexandria to
                        Athens was by way of Corfu or Smyrna.
                        Haicalis was soon afterwards appointed coun-
                        sel to the Customs Administration, the Rail-
                        way Administration, and other Government
                        departments, and enjoyed a high position at
                        the local Bar. In 1869 he went to Venice to
                        start a direct service between Venice and Alex¬
                        andria, and there made the acquaintance of Mr.
                        Cook, the founder of the great tourist agency,
                        which in those days was, it is needless to say, by
                        no means the gigantic organisation which it is
                        now. It is said that Haicalis was the first to
                        persuade Mr. Cook to come to Egypt and start
                        his business here, which has since developed
                        into the firm of Thos. Cook &amp; Son (Egypt),
                        Limited. The Press in Egypt was in those days
                        far worse than it is now, and the newspapers
                        levied blackmail on a very extensive scale. Ismail
                        tried to put an end to this abase, which had
                        become a public scandal, and commanded
                        Haicalis to establish a newspaper which would
                        have some regard for journalistic decency. A con¬
                        tract was made between the Ministry for Foreign
                        Affairs and Haicalis in 1873, and this was the
                        beginning of the “Phare d’Alexandrie." The
                        Khedive granted the paper a considerable
                        subvention, and the “Phared’Alexandrie" soon
                        became, under the editorship of Haicalis, one of
                        the leading journals in Egypt When Ismail
                        abdicated, the contract between the Egyptian
                        Government and the “Phare d'Alaxandrie”
                        not renewed. Haicalis, however, de-
                        termined to run the paper without a sub¬
                        vention, and for some time lost 35,000 francs
                        per annum in the attempt But he persevered
                        and in a comparatively short space of time
                        the “Phare” brought in a substantial yearly
                        profit to its proprietor of 50,000 francs.
                        The Pasha was Officer of the Order of the
                        Saviour,of the Order of the Crown of Italy,and
                        of the Legion of Honor, and held high
                        Egyptian honors and decorations.
                        The deceased, who had been a widower for
                        some years, leaves a son and four daughters to
                        mourn his loss. We beg to tender our deepest
                        sympathy to the family of the Pasha in their
                        irreparable bereavement.
                        The death of Dr. Haicalis Pasha removes
                        the best-known figure in the European Press
                        of Egypt, and we deeply regret the loss of an
                        upright and conscientious confrere.</p>

                    <p>We are glad to hear that Maltre Albrecht is
                        still making favorable progress towards reco¬
                        very.
                        We have received the following version of the
                        accident that befell him from reliable source.
                        Maltre Albrecht was returning from Tantah
                        in the company of Mr. Lee and Mr. Xenos at
                        the time of the accident The light in the
                        carriage being bad, his two companions were
                        sitting at each corner at the opposite end of
                        the carriage trying to read. Maltre Albrecht,
                        who had a newspaper, stood up by the door of
                        the carriage to get the light behind him.
                        Putting back his hands to steady himself, he
                        caught hold of the door, which had not been
                        fastened, and fell on to the railway. His two
                        companions immediately sought for the com-
                        munication cord, and found that there was
                        none. They then attempted to get to the next
                        carriage, along the footboard, but the speed
                        of the train and the absence of any hand
                        rails made it impossible. At Mansourah they
                        got out and demanded donkeys, which were
                        not to be had, and wired to the station
                        master of the station which they had left,
                        i.e., Samanoud. They were not a little relieved
                        to get an answering wire that Maitre Albrecht
                        had walked into the station with his head cut,
                        but with no further injury. As a matter of
                        fact Maltre Albrecht had been picked up un-
                        conscious on the permanent way. When
                        his friends came to meet him, they found no
                        traces of him, and after waiting for some time
                        were informed that he had been sent to hos¬
                        pital in the train. Assuming that bo had been
                        sent up to Cairo, they followed there, only to
                        find that he had been sent to Tantah hospital.
                        The unfortunate gentleman received first aid
                        at Samanoud from a Greek doctor.
                        Madame Albrecht immediately hurried down
                        to Tantah and found her husband lying in the
                        hospital with his head bandaged. Apparently
                        nothing else had been done by the doctor
                        responsible for the case, and Mme Albrecht
                        promptly brought her husband back to Cairo.</p>

                        Port Said, Saturday.
                        A vessel bearing the name of “Malaya”
                        arrived from the canal this morning at 6.25,
                        but of what nature this boat is it is difficult to
                        say without jumping to conclusions, owing-to
                        the peculiar and various characteristics she
                        presented. The remarkable facts about this
                        vessel are, that she is flying the Russian com¬
                        mercial flag, her funnel is pointed in Russian
                        commercial colours, her sides are of the same co¬
                        lour as those of the Russian Volunteer Fleet, her
                        officers are German, her deck crew is Russian,
                        she is fitted up as a hospital ship, her
                        passengers consist of wounded Russians, and
                        the man in charge,who can neither be described
                        as a captain or as a supercargo, is a Russian
                        naval officer.</p>

                    <p>The Russian torpedo boat "Rezvoy” also
                        arrived from the canal this morning some three-
                        and-a-half hours later. She is one of the
                        torpedo boats which escaped from Port Arthur,
                        and she is being supplied with coal by the
                        “Malaya." The canal tonnage of the "Rezvoy”
                        is registered as 103 tons and that of the
                        "Malaya” as 3,530 tons, and the cargo of the
                        latter is declared as 150 tons coal and various.</p>

                    <head>The sinking of the "congal"</head>
                    <p>It is semiofficially announced that an agree¬
                        ment has been made between the underwriters
                        of the Norwegian steamer “Congal,” which it
                        will be remembered was sunk at anchor by the
                        Harrison Line S.S. "Craftsman” some ten days
                        ago, and the Constantinople Salvage Associa¬
                        tion, by which the latter agree, on the no-cure-
                        no-pay principle, to salve the vessel and
                        her cargo entire. Since the “Congal” was sunk
                        she has set bodily into the mud for consider¬
                        ably over a foot and a half and her position
                        remains the same. The divers now report that
                        almost her entire main-deck has burst open,
                        and there is no doubt that the beam ends have
                        been torn away in very many places.
                        The value of the hull is £11,500, for
                        which sum she is insured, and that of the
                        cargo may be estimated at about £4,500.
                        The present intention is to try and lift her by
                        means of the floating power of empty lighters,
                        but in all probability this method will prove
                        unsuccessful as the value of the power of the
                        mud in which she is embedded is enormous.
                        Should this attempt fail the hole in her side will
                        be temporarily repaired, and a coffee-dam will be
                        built entirely round her, and she will then be
                        raised by means of pumps in exactly the same
                        manner as the battleship which sunk in
                        Gibraltar some two years ago. The success of
                        such a method is fairly certain, as the "Congal”
                        has only a displacement of 5,000 tons under her
                        present conditions, and that of the battleship
                        which was raised in this way was 13,000 tons.</p>

                        Here is a case of the transformation that
                        marriage so often effects in our modern upper-
                        class woman. She was once a pleasant-faced

                        transformed into a pretty and very smart
                        married woman. Mrs.Greville has many friends,
                        and gives some dinners and concerts in London.

                        dressed and jewelled to perfection. Her devoted
                        stepfather gives with a generous hand, and her
                        rubies, emeralds, and diamonds are among the
                        finest in England. She is fond of dogs, and may
                        sometimes be seen walking with a big white
                        boar hound.</p>
