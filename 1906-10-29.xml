                                    the Pyramids road, on Wednesday. By some oversight, the barrier
                                    was raised and several carriages had already crossed, when a
                                    goods train, northward bound, came up at full speed. Pascal
                                    Defranco, the chauffeur of the Prince, had sufficient presence
                                    of wind to draw up, and so avoided an accident, the result of
                                    which might have been no less fearful than that which befell the

                                    blood, a National­ist of the type of the late Sheikh Mohamed
                                    Abdo", and an efficient, honest, and energetic judge. His
                                    conduct at the Bar and on the Bench have won general respect for
                                    his abilities and admiration of his fairness and courage. A
                                    progressive and a patriot, firmly convinced that Egypt can only
                                    become a self-governing country when the Egyptians are morally
                                    and intellectually trained up to the European standard, he has
                                    had to bear much criticism from the conservative and Pan-Islamic
                                    elements, and even from Europeans, who considered him an
                                    unpractical idealist (a notion, by the way, which his legal
                                    success should have dispelled). His private life and his
                                    intellec­tual attainments alike fit him to bear the
                                    responsibilities of this new office with high credit.</p>

                                    just been sold at a profitable price. The area of the land sold
                                    is 2,469 square metres. The land was originally purchased by Mr.
                                    Con­stantine Meimarachi, the managing director, from the
                                    Egyptian Estates at £15 per metre, and he passed it over to the
                                    company at the same price. Owing to this action of Mr.
                                    Meimarachi, the profit to the company now is about £26 per
                                    metre,which gives a total profit to the company of about £26,000

                                    on which the company’s new building is. Mr. Meimarachi is to be
                                    congratulated on his foresight, as the profit of this
                                    transaction is solely due to him.</p></div>
