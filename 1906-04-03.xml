                    <p>Before writing this we happened to look at the August number of the ‘Revue d’Egypte et d’Orient,” and found on pages 352 and 353 a note on the coming season, the crowning glory in the brilliant existence of the Cercle Artistique. We will not repeat it here, but we will cite a few names mentioned—Tamagno, Caruso, Alvarez, Renaud, Boroi, Charlotte Wyns; Sammareo, Bellincioni, for opera ; for drama, Bartet, Rejane, Brand's, Guitry, pos¬sibly Sarah Bernhardt and Mounet Sully, An¬toine, Jean Coquelio, Le Bargy. Anyone can look up these names in the review in question. Whom have we had? Bellincioni for opera; for drama a week of Le Bargy, a week of the Lamberts, two performances of Coquelin,—and Moreno. And that is all. And what have we had? In opera, Asrael, a vulgar pantomime, Iris, Tannhaiiser completely travestied,Tosca, and Aida, of course; and in drama such stuff as Coeur de Moineau and La Closerie des Genets—all this done by a third-rate provincial troupe whose only two stars were far too dis<cb n="6"/> couraged to show their worth to any real extent. We are told that the reign of the Cercle is over, and that a new theatre is to be built. That is good news : we shall no longer have hurried selections made anyhow (with the exception of one or two performers chosen for individual reasons), and no more pieces which no one wants to see, even well done. We know our Cercle and have suffered much at their hands : they are indeed a Cercle en-¬closing in an unbroken ring all choice, and im-¬pervious to all public opinion, getting up exhibitions of pictures in which only a few bad French paintings are shown, to represent an International Fine Arts Exhibition. And we know our theatre at Cairo,—small, chilly, badly ventilated, with its interminable entr’-actes, and its crowd of apathetic abonnes, who annex every stall in the place long before the season begins, and who, daring the season, drown all the performance by ceaseless coughs, whispers, rustling, and shifting of feet.</p><p> They are not a large nor an important notion of Cairo : they have bought their seats as they might buy a frockcoat: a certain cachet, and veil of taste, gentility, and artistic propensities, enhanced by the chance of wearing evening dress, is obtained for the money. The few enlightened people who have boxes are an entire minority. Now that very minority—a few French and Italian and Syrian theatregoers, and very occasionally two or three of the English community, represents the real Cairo public for which the theatre should be open, that public who would go to good places in a good theatre, for good performances, but who will not go near the Khedivial Opera House except once in a way to a box. And that public is highly educated, musical, possessing more than one language, knowing books and plays and pictures, a public most of whom have heard the great plays and operas at Paris, London, and elsewhere : why then exclude them 1 We want a large theatre properly built, with not only stalls but some convenient circle where the abounds might be housed—they might have the seats there—and welcome. The stalls and boxes, except a very few, should be open to everyone: in a word it should be an attraction for this very resident public and for the Visitors. A ; good manager who knows that his “house” depends on his efforts would soon see that good pre- formances were given, and that people were not played with, and laughed at, treated with that cynical and financial contempt which we have had hitherto; the artistes would respond to a good audience instead of showing, as did Coquelin, and to a slight degree the Le Bargy troupe, that they are playing to the ignorant. The Cairo audience has been called cold : of course it is, this abound section which takes up so much place in the Cairo theatre, the Con¬tinental Bar, and such places. and so little if any—in the life and thought of European Cairo.</p><p> The state of affairs and the remedy is obvious to anyone who frequents the theatre. Everyone has paid, and so no one cares : the very few who do are not listened to. The whole at¬mosphere real as metaphorical of the theatre is now chilly, now stifling—apathy smiled on by cynicism. Of course we can net always hope for the great names we have quoted, but we can always have some: and the troupe in general can be better selected, as also some conductor whose sole interests are not brass and crashing effects out of place,—as also a chorus with some sort of voice and volume, not to mention time. At present the average night is like, let us say, an "off-night” at Malta, if as good : and in the Valetta Theatre you pay eighteenpence , or at most two or three shillings, for a stall. Let us hope that the change is really going to take place that we are going to have what we want, and that-the 1905-6 season is the last inglorious flicker of what can we call it but pre artistic Cairo. Let the financiers return to their stocks and shares, and the abounds to their bars, and leave the management open for those who will devote themselves to pleasing Cairo, and the theatre to those who are only too ready to be pleased, who can appreciate and applaud whatever is really worthy of their attention. </p>

                <p>A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY.</p>
                <p>NEXT YEAR’S PROSPECTS.</p>
                <p>The first annual report of the above com¬pany, which appeared in our columns yesterday, will have been pleasant reading to the many shareholders of this very successful enterprise. Seldom in any country, and hardly ever in Egypt, has a board of directors been enabled to show such splendid results for the first year of a company’s existence. This is all the more remarkable when one considers that, the working period has only been for about nine months, and that the company has only had full use of the total issued capital during six months.
                </p><p>The dividend on the ordinary shares is at the rate of 20% per annum, free of income tax, or l/ in the £ and the large sum of £102,090. 12.10 has been placed to reserve. Besides this, the whole of the preliminary expenses, amounting to £23,98.14.8, are written off, and a balance profit of £9,189 11.7 is carried forward into the newyear. Doubtless the Chairman at the first annual meeting, which will be held in London on the 11th inst., will give some further information of an interesting nature to the shareholders, but the above figures already speak for themselves with much force, notwithstanding what he may yet have to say
                </p><p>It is known that the company own large and valuable agricultural estates, besides several building lands, bought at considerably below present values, and these, coupled with the conservative policy of placing the above sum of £102.090. 2.10 to the reserve fund, entitle the Egyptian Estates to rank with the premier companies in this country.
                </p><p>In most cases the success of a company is the work of one individual and the Egyptian Estates, Limited, is no exception to the role. Mr. Montagu Summers, the managing director and founder of the company, has displayed remarkable ability in the conduct of the com-pany’s affairs, as the balance-sheet proves, and the ungrudging way in which he has worked for the benefit of the general body of shareholders has presented to us an object- lesson on the conduct of public companies in this country. His efforts have at the same time been well backed up by the very able members of the advisory board in Egypt.
                </p><p>Although the first year has been so successful, we are informed that there is every sign that the coming year will be even more so. The company begins its new year free of all preliminary expenses, which is quite exceptional, and with a profit of £9 189.11.7 in hand. Considerable profits on building lands, of which only a part were taken into last year's accounts, are due in the coming 12 months, and the agricultural estates will also have a full twelve months’ working, which will materially enhance the profits in the next balance sheet.

                    <p>THE PROGRESS OF ROYALTY.</p>
                    <p>Bedreshein, Sunday.</p>
                    <p>The usually somnolent village of Bedreshein, which is the station for Sakkara (refer to Baedaecker), is in a great state of excitement over the approaching visit of the Royal tra-vellers, who are timed to arrive there at ten o’clock tomorrow, Inshallah! Inter alia the venerable Sheikh of Bedreshein, Mohamed Dodo, has prepared according to his humble estimation a worthy reception, consisting of Bedouin flags and banners draped across the hamlet's most noble thoroughfare. Mohamed is the proud owner of sixty donkeys and donkey-boys, and these have also been decked out for the auspicious occasion.
                    </p><p>With all due acknowledgments for the kindly intention, his Royal Highness will be wise in preferring the more comfortable locomotion of the Khedive’s brougham, which his Highness has graciously placed at the disposal of his Royal guests. In this vehicle, by the bye, the distinguished travellers will drive to the Tombs of Sakkara. The progress of Princes acts as a healthy stimulus to national life. Potemkin built villages along the route followed by Catherine of Russia ; Kaiser William’s visit extended very considerably the system of com- munications of the Ottoman metropolis ; H.I.M. the Sultan proceeds once a year to Stamboul by way of a sanded road. So, too, at Sakkara. a carriageable route, formed of Nilotic mud, crosses the smiling grass lands between the palm-groves of Bedreshein and the edge of the Lybian wilderness.
                    </p><p>In the scant shade of this magnificent grove lie the rains of the Temple of Phta, the Sun-God, a picturesque grouping of columns and Egyptian capitols, scattered around a silent pool. Beyond this, and similarly protected from the tense rays of the real god of day, is the statue of Rameses II, on whom be peace. It is of gigantic proportions but withal has nothing of awful majesty about it—indeed the sculptor has given to the Royal lips an expression of beautiful benevolence. When the writer arrived, he found the custodians busily engaged in washing his Egyptian greatness with a plentiful supply of soap and water !
                    </p><p>The desert route is lined with stones, and is regularly patrolled by Egyptian police. The Matson Marietta has also been fitted out for the nonce and in one of the rooms looking out on to the desert a table has been daintily pre¬pared on which two glasses and as many napkins stand conspicuous. This, however, was a sacri¬-legious peep through a crack in the partition. Also we may note that a wag has added to the Osirian inscriptions on the Tomb of Mira the more popular one of “God bless the Prince of Wales.”	XENOS.
                    </p><p>The Prince and Princess of Wales paid a visit to Sakkarah yesterday. T.R.H. left Abdeen Palace at 8.25 a.m. for Cairo station, whence they proceeded at 8.40 by special train to Bedreshein, arriving there at 9.10 a.m. The journey to Sakkarah was accomplished by 11 a.m. and after visiting the Temple and the Serapeum, the Royal party lambed at Mariette’s House. Leaving Sakkarah about 8 p.m. their Royal Highnesses reached Cairo at 6 o’clock, having travelled from Bedreshein on board H.H. the Khedive's yacht Tehel el Bahrein.

                    <p>"Al Zaher” says : -</p>
                    <p>The Kings of England have a very good custom of sending their Heirs Apparent to visit the colonies, which they are one day de-tined to role over. These visits are not only useful for the Government hot for the Princes themselves. The Prince and Princess of Wales are now on a visit to Egypt, which welcomes them and receives them with great joy and with as much cordiality as was our own Khedive received at Windsor Castle. Now on this matter we have a word to say to some native cavillers, whose gossiping must cease. Some people appear to think that this official visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Egypt is equivalent to an acknowledgment that in the opinion of England this country is a British colony. They argue that the pro¬gramme of the arrangements made for the visit of the Prince aid Princess show that the official festivities in Egypt will be quite as elaborate as they were in India. They declare that we Egyptians are, just as though we were Skilluks from the Sudan, to be decked up to please the royal guests, for a joust with old rifles and holding Arab sports of an anti¬quated fashion. Where are Amrhibn-el-Aassi and his heroes, where i- Khalid ih el-Wel eed and Tarik ibn Zyad ? What would there say when they saw how the world was now-a days and how poor a figure their descendants now out! To these and all such cavillings we make the following reply :—
                    </p><p>The visit of our Royal guests is of great use to Egypt. They will see with their own eyes how prosperous and peaceable is the state of our land and thus they may take measures on their return home to induce the high Govern¬ment authorities to bestow on Egypt the in¬dependence which she deserves.

                    <p>LARGEST SHIP THROUGH CANAL.</p>
                    <p>A PILOT’S EXPLOITS.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Monday.</p>
                    <p>The leviathan S.S. Quiloa, the second of four new British India steamers of the same type, recently built for their coast service, arrived here on Friday. One of our brilliant examples of seamanship, a Greek pilot, board-ed her at once and proceeded, much to the amusement of the numerous onlookers, to run over two buoys, one of which was 17 feet high and was surmounted by a gas lamp and gallery. After some ‘ little incidents,” which he informed the captain were "No-ding Sare” (Anglice "Nothing sir”) he sent two enor¬-mous lines to a mooring buoy on the wrong side of the harbour and went ahead in such a manner that these had to be left OD the buoy and recovered afterwards. The process of bringing the ship in, etc., occupied four and a half hours,— a record performance, the ship being eventually fast at half-past two p.m.
                    </p><p>The Quiloa is a turret ship of the latest type, carrying 12,500 tons cargo and displacing 16,700 tons. She has a length of 478 feet and a huge beam of 50 feet, which measurements make her quite the largest ship to go through the Canal. She steams 11 knots and is intended for service between Bombay and Calcutta. She went through the Canal in 29 hours, of which three were taken up in being tied up to permit the passage of other ships.
                    </p><p>The S.S. Chatham.
                    </p><p>Two days ago a telegram arrived, "Passage round Chatham dear,” and ships passed the spot with ease. To-day, evidently, other pieces of broken hall have been discovered, for the passage has been stopped for a few hours until such time as the channel can be re- buoyed, as was the case form«rly. No actual reliable information can be gathered as to the state of things at Kil 10, but it is antici¬pated that the Canal will be absolutely clear of all signs of wreckage of this somewhat interesting ship by the end of April. Consi¬derable dredging has to be done, but the greater part of the mass of twisted and broken ironwork has been removed When down at the spot a fur days ago I saw on the eastern bank no less a quantity of broken plates and frame* than 8'H) tons. This, coupled with the 700 tens odd now in Port Said, should pretty nearly represent the whole of the hall.

                    <p>(PROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Suez Monday.</p>
                    <p>Early this morning a salute of guns announ-ced the arrival of the Holy Carpet by the S.S. Rehmanieh from Tor.
                    </p><p>In the afternoon the usual procession through the principal streets of the town took place, the route being decorated with flags. The escort of the Mahmal in-cluded Mounted Police, Infantry, and Mountain Artillery.
                    </p><p>The Mahmal leaves by special train for Cairo to-night.</p>
                    <p>The Holy Carpet and its escort left Tor for Suez on Sunday. The festival of the return of the Holy Carpet will take place in Cairo pro¬bably on Saturday next. H. H. the Khedive will preside at the ceremony and the Ministries and State Departments will be closed.
                    </p><p>ARCHDEACONRY OF THE CHURCH
                    OF ENGLAND IN SYRIA.</p>
                    <p>The Venerable Archdeacon Frere has accept¬ed the offer of preferment in England in the diocese of Gloucester, and will vacate the archdeaconry and the chaplaincy of Beyront early in the summer. The Bishop in Jerusalem has offered the archdeaconry and also the chaplaincy of Beyront to the Rev. Canon Strange, who has held the chaplaincy at Port Said since 1882. Canon Strange has been a most diligent and earnest chaplain in this difficult post. He built the station church. He was nominated by the Bishop to an honorary canonry in St. George’- Church in 1901.
                    </p><p>Canon Strange will take time to consider his acceptance of the offer now made to him. There can be no doubt of his suitableness for it.
                    </p><p>FLOREAT DAMANHOUR.</p>
                    <p>The inhabitants of Damanhour have been eager for the Government to endow their town with a municipal regime of a similar character to those at Mansourah and Medinet el-Fayoum, and it has been therefore decided to establish a mixed local Commission of eleven members in that town. The members will be the Moudir of the Behera province (chairman), the inspector of the Western Towns and State Buildings or his delegate, and the sanitary inspector of the province or his substitute. These persons will be members in right of their position. The remainder wall consist of four European and (oar native members chosen by the electorate.

                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil. Deliciously
                        scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can do, makes it
                        pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the muscles, and a
                        deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to give
                        it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or the
                        effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates
                        are so fatal.</p>
                    <p>Invaluable for immediately curing mosquito and insect bites and for greatly
                        preventing them.</p>
