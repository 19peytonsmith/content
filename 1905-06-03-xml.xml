                SPEECH BY LORD LANDSDOWNE.</head>
                <p>LONDON, June 2.</p>
                <p>At a Conservative dinner at the Holborn Restaurant, Lord Landsdowne, referring to
                    the hope expressed by Sir Ed. Grey that the Anglo-Japanese Agreement would be
                    maintained, said that at no time on either side had there been any question
                    whatever of withdrawal from the alliance. It is our opinion that, when the time
                    comes when we must consider the renewal of the agreement, the only practical
                    question will be whether we should not seek some means of strengthening and
                    consolidating it. The alliance has been a potent instrument lor maintaining
                    peace, and if it be possible so to modify it that it would prevent the spread of
                    a conflagration when it has begun, but prevent the conflagration from breaking
                    out, all true lovers of peace would recommend such modifications ,</p>
                <p>There has never been a moment when our relations with France were upon a firmer
                    base, and if the inner history of the anxious mouths lately passed be ever
                    written, it will show that our understanding with France has greatly mitigated
                    the friction and trouble inevitable when a great war is still in progress. Our
                    alliance with Japan and our agreement with France are alike with no selfish or
                    aggressive purpose in view. Our sole object has been to secure peace and
                    restrict the evils of war. (R.)</p>

                <p>WASHINGTON, June 3.</p>
                <p>Count Cassini called on President Roosevelt yesterday. The President expressed
                    the earnest hope,as a friend of Russia, that she would seek to conclude peace
                    with Japan in response to the wish of the entire civilised world. The
                    prolongation of the war would mean increased Japanese demands. He pointed out
                    that Russia could hardly hope to win, and that influenced solely by motives of
                    humanity he offered his services as a mediator or an intermediary in any way
                    acceptable to Russia. Count Cassini replied that he was without instructions,
                    but that be personally believed that Russia would continue the war, because the
                    moment is not advantageous for the discussion of peace Russia has not lost any
                    of her own territory and nothing in the present situation necessitates suing for
                    peace. He promised, however, to communicate President Roosevelt's view and offer
                    to the Tsar. (Reuter.)</p>

                <p>POLICEMAN Shoots AN ITALIAN—A most unfortunate and serIous affray took place
                    yesterday evening in Sisters-street, Alexandria, in which a member of the
                    Alexandria City Police (an Italian) was seriously implicated While in plain
                    clothes he had a discussion with a compatriot in a drinking place in the street
                    The subject of the discussion is believed to have been a woman, and the two
                    Italians grew more and more excited until from words they came to blows. The
                    policeman drew a loaded revolver and held it at his compatriot in a menacing
                    manner. The latter sprang at him and in a fierce struggle endeavoured to disarm
                    his opponent But the policeman succeeded in holding on to the weapon, and,
                    getting his arms free, he emptied the contents of two of the chambers into the
                    man’s body, who fell writhing to the floor. The injured man was at once conveyed
                    to the European Hospital, and it is not expected that the two wounds he
                    sustained will be mortal. According to the latest accounts he is progressing as
                    satisfactorily as can be expected under the circumstances. The policeman was
                    arrested and disarmed, and subsequently handed over by the authorities of the
                    Alexandria City Police to the Italian Consulate. It is needless to state that he
                    will be expelled from the police force.</p>

                ALLEGED VACCINATION SCANDAL.</head>
                <p>Considerable sensation has occurred in Cairo owing to the report that two deaths
                    have taken place in the Capital within the last few days as the result of
                    vaccination.</p>
                <p>The German Consulate has opened an enquiry into the circumstances attending the
                    death of Mr. Heinrich Klein, a young German who died at one of the Cairo
                    Hospitals on Thursday evening after an illness of some days, which is alleged to
                    have been occasioned by some vaccine given him by a local medical man.</p>
                <p>A Cairo contemporary remarked yesterday —</p>
                <p>Une certaine emotion regne en villa a la suite de deux deces survenus a la suite
                    de vaccination. On dit—et nous reproduisons ces bruits sous toutes reserves—que
                    les instruments qui out servi a l'operation n’auraient pas ete suffisamment
                    sterilises. Sur trois cas de vaccination, deux ont eu une issue fatale.</p>
                <p>It is sincerely to be hoped that a satisfactory explanation of these cases will
                    be discovered, as if it is found that the deaths ensued owing to the reason
                    given above, a serious set back might be given to the progress of vaccination in
                    Egypt. During last year 408,981 successful vaccinations were performed, as
                    compared with 408,856 in 1903. it would be a great pity if this steady progress
                    in vaccinating were checked owing to the alarm arising from the fatality in
                    Cairo. The importance of vaccination in Egypt is very great, and we may mention
                    that, out of 185 cases of small-pox which were reported in Cairo last year,
                    one-half occurred amongst the European population, more especially amongst the
                    Greeks. This large number of cases amongst Europeans appears to be due to want
                    of vaccination on their part. Many of the Greek patients were treated at the
                    hospital for infectious diseases, and it is reported that those who contracted
                    the disease severely and died had never been vaccinated.</p>
                <p>The vaccine produced at the Cairo Vaccine Institute has up to now given very
                    satisfactory results. There were no less than 4,155 cases of small-pox, of which
                    854 terminated fatally, in Egypt last year.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>NEW MUSIC HALL FOR ALEXANDRIA</head>
                <p>Alexandria is at last within measurable distance of possessing a music ball which
                    will be worthy of the city. We say this in no disparagement of the
                    establishment, known as the Alhambra, which has been conducted with remarkable
                    success by Mr. Conegliano for some years past Mr. Conegliano, however, has
                    hitherto laboured under a great disadvantage in that his tenure of the theatre
                    site has been a most uncertain one. Now, as we announced yesterday, the
                    proprietor of the Alhambra has signed a ten years’ lease with the owner of the
                    ground, Mr. G. B. Alderson, and his tenure is secure et least for that
                    period.</p>
                <p>The result of this agreement is that a new music-ball is to be built on the plot
                    of ground contiguous to the present Alhambra, on the south side, which is now
                    used as a garden. The theatre will be larger than the existing one, with
                    attractive boxes and the additional feature of a gallery. It will be entirely
                    constructed of iron, and will comprise every modern contrivance against the
                    chances of an outbreak of fire. The plans have been prepared and are to be sent
                    in a few days to England, where the theatre is to be built and sent out here to
                    be put together.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>HUTCHINSON NURSING HOME</head>
                <p>Our Cairo Correspondent writes"--- Cairenes, unlike Alexandrians, cannot complain
                    of a want of Nursing Homes, for there are now three such institutions in Cairo,
                    the latest being the Hutchinson Nursing Home, which was opened about a fortnight
                    ago and which I have had an opportunity of visiting. This horne is well adapted
                    to both surgical and medical cases, the rooms on the second floor being set
                    apart for the former cases and those on toe first floor for the latter. The
                    tourist, too, who has come to Egypt for change and rest, and who is not actually
                    ill, but feels himself unable to stand the bustle and racket of hotel life, will
                    find himself well-cared for here, and he will also have the services of the
                    resident medical officer at his disposal, should he require them. Patients,
                    however, may be attended by their own doctors.</p>
                <p>A visit to this Home shows the great care with which every detail in the planning
                    and furnishing of it has been thought out, and not a single possible want of a
                    patient has been left unsupplied. Every room is fitted with the latest
                    electrical conveniences, in the way of stoves, lights, and fans, is furnished in
                    the most luxurious manner, and has the advantage of being differently arranged
                    and furnished to any of its companions, so that every taste is suited. Separate
                    parte of the house are also apportioned to the nurses, to the Goanese servants,
                    and to the Arabs. There are in all twelve single rooms set apart for patients,
                    and in addition to these they have both an exceedingly comfortable and
                    well-arranged diningroom and a lounge which will compare favorably with any
                    first-class hotel drawing room.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>KARIANS IN EGYPT</head>
                <p>Prof. Sayce has completed a study of some Lydian and Karian inscriptions discovered in Egypt, and lately published in a more or less revised form. Two new characters --one identical with the Cypriote to and the other with the apparent value of a — are the chief features of these, and it should be noted that most of them are to be need boustrophedon. The paper will shortly be published in the Proceedings of the Society of which Prof. Sayce is the President, and, with his former communications on the subject, make up all the Karian and Lydian texts yet discovered. Most of them are of but a few lines each, and the Lydian and Karian alphabets seem to be the greatest acquisitions that they have yet yielded. It is a pity that those interested in the subject do not turn their attention to the Greco-Egyptian Magic Papyri, among the so-called "gibberish” incantations  of which are several words ending ia -anda, which may not improbably turn out to be Karian. The settlement of many Karian mercenaries in the Fayoum and elsewhere must certainly have left traces in the literature of their adopted country, could we only hit upon them.</p>

                <p>TRADE COMBINATION.</p>
                <p>( From our correspondent. )</p>
                <p>Nicosia, May 36.</p>
                <p>The idea of combining together for trade purpose* cannot yet be said to have made
                    much headway among the commercial community of Cyprus. The people of Larnaca and
                    Limassol are now, however, to have an opportunity of becoming familiarised with
                    this method of doing business, as a steamship company has lately been formed at
                    both places, mainly for cargo trade with Egypt, while an important brick and
                    tile factory has just commenced operations at Limassol as a societe anonyme.</p>
                <p>It is to be hoped that the two steamship companies will not work on rival lines,
                    but that they will see the wisdom of uniting together and so acquire sufficient
                    power to do a useful and profitable carrying trade with our nearest markets.</p>
                <p>If the brick and tile factory succeeds in producing good-building material at a
                    moderate price it should have a successful future. There is an evident tendency
                    in this island to use roofing tiles in place of the mud roofs, and it is
                    regarded rather as a mark of superiority for a villager to roof his building.
                    Several mud cottages were washed away in the Limassol district during the last
                    winter season, and this should stimulate the taste for bricks, which will not be
                    so easily affected by wet weather.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>PREVALENCE OF SCALE DISEASE.</head>
                <p>There are complaints of scale disease among the carob and fruit trees in various parts of the island. On the other hand it is reported that the unusually heavy winter rains have washed the scale from many orange and lemon trees which had been affected, and that a larger crop of fruit yielding better prices has resulted.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>THE SOAP INDUSTRY</head>
                <p>There is also gazetted an Order in Council reducing the import duty leviable on vegetable oils used in the manufacture of soap from the £2 per 100 okes heretofore charged ; provided that such oils are rendered unfit tor alimentary purposes at the expense of the importer and under the supervision of the Customs. This reduction of duty should give a considerable impetus to the local soap industry. Some years ago there were seven or eight soap factories in the island, the import duty on oils then being at the rate now fixed by the new order. The duty, however, was raised to £2 per 100 okes in order to prevent the importation of cotton seed oil for adulteration with the native olive oil, and as a consequence this industry  was crippled and there exists to-day only one small soap factory. It is generally felt that the reduction in the duty is a wire measure.</p>

                    Idris Bey Ragheb. M W. G. M of Egypt, in the committee room of the Grand Lodge
                    on Tuesday evening last, 30th May. There were present: Dr. W. C. Mackenzie,
                    Messrs. P. Plunkett, and F. A. Beale, president. The minutes of the last
                    half-yearly and extraordinary meet-ing were read, passed, and confirmed. Mr. G.
                    Scott-Dalgleish wrote regretting his inability to he present owing to another
                    meeting. The President next produced the balance-sheet for the half-year ending
                    May, which, after being audited, was unanimously accepted The balance-sheet
                    shows a net total of credit amounting to L.E. 387.621, a considerable increase
                    over the balance of the last half-year. It was notified that the monies had been
                    invested in accordance with the wishes of the trustees and that the bonds had
                    been deposited with the Trust bankers.</p>
                <p>A letter was read from Mr. Jas. Edgell, J. P. (the trustee in England) who was
                    watching the local trustee's interests over Dora and Reggie De Vere. A good
                    amount was given of the program they were making with their stadias, etc. It was
                    proposed that a hearty vote of thanks be accorded to Mr. Edgell for his greet
                    kindness to three orphan children ; he had them at his home on every occasion,
                    and be was using every endeavour to gain admission into the Duke of York's Royal
                    Military School for Reggie, the necessary certificates being asked for from the
                    trustees. A cordial vote of thanks was also expressed to the Permanent Committee
                    of the National Grand Lodge of Egypt, for their kindness in again voting the sum
                    of L.E. 20 from the Benevolent Fund for the year 1904.</p>
                <p>The President intimated that he had now been three years president of the Trust
                    and in thanking the trustees for their help and sup port, tendered his
                    resignation. Dr. W. C. Mackenzie proposed re-election, strongly urged by Mr.
                    Plunkett. The President, whilst acknowledging</p>
                <p>lodging the honor and confidence of the vote, thought that as the work was now
                    all in a satisfactory and smooth condition, some other member of the Trust
                    should have a turn as president. Dr. Mackenzie still strongly urged Mr. Beale to
                    accept the position for a farther period, which was finally agreed to by him. At
                    the same time the trustees wished it to be placed on record that they fully
                    appreciated the fact that it was owing to his untiring efforts that the funds
                    were in such a satisfactory conuition.</p>
