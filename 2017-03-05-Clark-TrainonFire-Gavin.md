  Train on Fire
In the issue of Monday, October 22, 1906 in the Egyptian Gazette there was a short article on page three written about an express train that caught on fire due to an exploding lamp in one of the first-class cars.
This article gathered my attention for several reasons, the first of which being the words fire and exploding lamp. How often did lamps just explode and cause fires in 1906 in Egypt? Apparently to deal with this burning train car, the best plan of attack was to detach it from the rest of the train and send villagers to put out the fire, which makes sense so as to not allow the fire to spread all around the train, but what about the people inside the car that was on fire?? This brings me to my last point of curiosity, which is certain members of the crew that helped put out the fire. According to the paper “Three Italians distinguished themselves by the coolness and the effectiveness with which they worked.” First of all, where did these Italians come from, because it was the villagers of a town called Kift that were supposed to put out the fire. Furthermore, this just proves that Italians must’ve been cool all throughout history and still are to this day because I’m just imagining three big guys with slicked back hair in suits named Tony communicating wonderfully with each other and the other villagers to put out this train fire. The article concludes with the fact that there were no injuries in this fire, which is pretty miraculous considering the assumed lack of experience among the villagers who worked to put out the fire.
