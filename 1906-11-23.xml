                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can

                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>

                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot

                        few months ago by pome German archaeologists. These views are being
                        exhibited at Messrs. Reiser and Binder’s photographic gallery at Alexandria,
                        and are well worth inspection. They were taken by Mr. Binder, and help one
                        to realize the extraordinary fact that suchan important series of ruins
                        could have existed for centuries on- known and unvisited on the very
                        threshold of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Fayoum Technloal SohooL</p>
                    <p>At a meeting of omdehs and notables, held last Saturday at Medinet el Fayoum,
                        at which Major Elgood and Mr. Wileor, an acknowledged authority on technical
                        education, were present, the program of the proposed technical school was
                        discussed. Thanks to the efforts of Major Elgood and Mohamed Ali Bey, the
                        sum of ten thousand pounds sterling has been collected and deposited in the
                        National Bank, which will suffice for the construction and furnishing of the
                        school. Other funds are : £300 annually from subscribers, £ 00 from products
                        of the school, and the Government annual grant of £850. Military exemption
                        will be extended to students who have been more than four years at the
                        school. The Government proposes issuing a similar grant to the Beni Souef
                        Industrial school.</p>

                    <p>By asking Mme Ourie to give a public course of lectures the Paris University
                        has done great homage to the sex she so ably represents Ladies who devote
                        themselves to scientific studies are rather few, but many apply themselves
                        to the study of literature and especial y modern languages. The Berlins
                        Schools of Cairo (I, Sharia Kamel) and of Alexandria (12, rue Rosette) count
                        amongst their pupils many ladies of the best society who learn French,
                        English, German. Italian, and make rapid progress in a very short space of

                    <p>Alexandria received its letters from Cairo and the interior late this miming
                        owing to the breakdown of a goods train near Mahrnal Gazal, after Kafr
                        Dawar. The up and down lines were completely blocked. A relief train was
                        dispatched from Alexandria on receipt r.f the news, early this morning, to
                        tranship the passengers and mails from the night train from Cairo. This was
                        effected with remarkable speed, and both the. lines were completely cleared.
                        The mails arrived the Moharrem Bey terminus at 8.30 o’clock this morning and
                        the first morning express from Cairo arrived at Alexandria to the
                        minute.</p>
                    <p>A passenger by the night train, who gave us this account, states that great
                        praise is due to Mr. Hilpern, Divisional Inspector at Alexandria, for the
                        prompt way in which he had the passengers and mails transferred and the line
                        cleared.</p>
                    <p>THE PILGRIMAGE.</p>

                    <p> </p>
                    <p>The following is one of many good stories which Sir Evelyn Wood has to tell
                        Sudan in his book, "From Midshipman to Field Marshal.” Referring to
                        Major-General the Hon. J. Dorme', hd says: "Two sheikhs rode into the
                        general’s camp with a message from the Mahdi, exhorting him and his follow
                        era to submit and thus save their bodies in this world, and their souls in
                        the next, by embracing the Mohamedan faith. The sheikh talked of the
                        wondrous powers of the Mahdi, and when Dormer differed with him, said,
                        ‘Well, can you do the marvelous things the Mahdi performs, such as praying
                        for rain and ensure its falling?’ Dormer, like all of us, knew that the
                        Mahdi only prayed for rain when his barometer was falling, and having
                        himself but one eye, be turned his back to the sheikhs, and taking oat his
                        glass eye be threw it up the air and caught it, saying, ‘Can your Mahdi do
                        that’ The sheikhs turned and ran without a word.”</p>

                    <p>Cairo Model Workshops </p>
                    <p>Johnson Pasha, in his report on that excellent institution, the model
                        workshops at Cairo, during the past year, remarks:-</p>
                    <p>This being the third year of the first four years’ course in the Cairo Model
                        Workshops it is satisfactory to be able to state that the results justify
                        the experiment even more fully than did those of the first and second years
                        which had already decided the Government to extend the operation of the
                        system. The work his therefore almost passed beyond the stage of experiment.
                        We can fairly say that the result is success: the question to be solved at
                        the end of 1906 is how great the measure of successes. I have no doubt that
                        in the future considerable modifications in detail will be necessary. These
                        establishments are being created to meet an urgently fell want. The country,
                        and Cairo especially, is developing in certain directions at extraordinary
                        speed, and this development naturally brings special needs into prominence.
                        As this pressure diminishes, and what is now wanted urgently, and eagerly
                        sought or, becomes a normal asset, other needs will be felt, and other
                        demands will be made; and it will be for those then in control of the system
                        to feel to a certain extent the pulse of the country, in regard to this
                        matter, and to introduce such modifications as regards I number of subjects
                        taught, higher development, and greater specialization as altered j
                        circumstances may indicate, bearing in mind always the principle underlying
                        this work—that theory should be the handmaid of practice.</p>

                        on Wednesday afternoon the Francis Joseph quay. It appears that the P. and
                        0. had replaced Somalis by Arabs for transhipping the Brindisi mail. The
                        Somalis were naturally angered, and made an attack on the Arabs, who were
                        soon joined by others, and after several had been wounded on both aides, the
                        Somalia retreated before the overwhelming odds to the British Consulate, for
                        refuge. Mr. Cameron handed them over to the authorities, and the gang are
                        now in the barrack calls. In the fighting a policeman was severely wounded
                        on the head by a blow from a bludgeon.</p>
                    <p>Pablio excitement prevails, and should the authorities be ill-advised enough
                        to set the Somalis at liberty, farther disorders would be</p>
                    <p>Feared. </p>

                        commenced. The question, however, will be discussed at the general meeting

                    <p>AMERICAN RESEARCH IN EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>Egypt is becoming more and more a centre of interest for American scholars
                        and tourists. The enormous and ever-increasing incrusion of Americans, who
                        people the Nile each winter from Cairo to Khartum, bears witness to this
                        fact, while the numerous representatives of science and learning who are now
                        busily engaged in practical research mark the more serious concern which tbe
                        educational aspect of Egypt has among the Americans.</p>
                    <p>During the coming season Mr. Albert M. Lythgoe, who has heretofore
                        represented the Boston Museum and Harvard University in the field, is to
                        commence an important series of excavations in the interests of the
                        Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Lytbgoe has the reputation among practical
                        Egyptologists of being one of the strongest scholars and most progressive
                        and skilled excavators in the field, and his course in the work which he is
                        bow undertaking for the New York museum will be watched with deep interest

                        reason Mr. Currelly has agreed to superintend the work of making it. The
                        privilege thus granted is almost unheard of, but it must be admitted that it
                        is all of a part with the exceeding liberality and broadmindedness which
                        characterize the entire course and conduct of the eminent director of the

                        was burnt at the bookbinders, now many years ago. nosnoh valuable mass of
                        similar documents has been secured in one lot, as the twelve hundred Arabic
                        papyrus manuscripts acquired recently by the University of Heidelberg, which
                        has secured what was known as the Schott Reinhardt collection.</p>
                    <p>The documents are not in every case papyrus ones, there being a wooden tablet
                        inscribed with part of the seventh Sura of the Koran, an Arabic letter
                        written upon the blade bone iof a goat, a tradition-soroll containing the
                        Sahifa of Ibn Lahia, and an extremely old Arabic book dated Hegira 239.</p>
                    <p>The most important documents are a large number of splendidly written texts
                        concerning (financial matters connected with Korra-ibn Bharik, governor of
                        Egypt, in the second half of the first century of the Hegira. A selection of
                        the most important of the papyri has been published under the editorship of
                        Dr. C. H. Becker, of Heidelberg, in a costly volume which does credit to the
                        University. There are autotypes of the texts, transliteration and
                        translation, a complete introduction, and a lexicon of the more important
                        Arabic words. In the Museums of Vienna, Cairo, Berlin Heidelberg there are
                        now sufficient Arabic records to satisfy the wish of any competent Moslem
                        scholar desirous of writing a history of Egypt from the Muhamedan point of
                        view. A work that is sure to be attempted by European scholars, if some
                        native Egyptian does not undertake the task.</p>
