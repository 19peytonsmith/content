                    <head>A SECOND SUEZ CANAL.</head>
                    <p>As supplementary to the remarks in our leading article yesterday we may state
                        that one of the difficulties in the way of the con­struction of a second
                        Suet Canal—assuming that the question whether the original con­cession gives
                        the Canal Company a monopoly is shelved—is the supply of labor.</p>
                    <p>The construction of the Canal in the ’sixties was only made possible at the
                        start by the relentless application of the con-tie, and it was not till the
                        ghastly loss of life and widespread suffering caused thereby had beoome a
                        scandal in the eyes of Europe that Ismail Pasha ceased the supply of forced
                        labour and paid a very large forfeit to the Company.</p>
                    <p>Lady Duff-Gordon’s letters, give a vivid description of the misery ; of the
                        fellaheen at the time, and to-day no one dreams of reviving the abuses of
                        the past But without the oorvto where is the labour fbr our hypothetical
                        canal to be found 1 Tens of thousands of workmen most be fed and boosed. The
                        coun­try near the canal produces nothing and there is no unemployed
                        population in Egypt. Ask the fellaheen to come to the new canal and
                        work—they will prefer'to cultivate their own fields. The towns have not
                        enough work­men for buildings and public works, wages have risen with the
                        price of commodities, and we doubt if the offer of P.T. 5 a day would
                        attract a quarter of the neoessary laborers.</p>
                    <p>It remains to import labor—from wbat quarter t European workmen are too
                        oostly, the Egyptian and other Governments ijould have a word to say about
                        the employment of Chinese and Indian oooliee, and their transport and
                        housing would enormously increase thd expenses of construction. These
                        considerations alone seem to us to oondemn the scheme entirely.</p>

                            the Hospital for the Insane, there are now no less than fifteen

                        <p>E.T.C. Dramatic Entertainment at Suez. —The festivities in Suez to
                            commemorate the recent visit of a Port - Said football team culminated
                            on Friday last in an entertainment in the E. T. C. theatre, given by the
                            "Exiles" Dramatic Club. The first part of the programme was vocal.
                            "Good-bye, Dolly Gray" was well rendered by - Mr. Durrant, but it must
                            have been very sad for poor Dolly, who should have felt convinced of the
                            absolute finality of the poor man’s departure. Messrs. Churchill,
                            Dug-more, and Blyth were all good, but the “clou" was undoubtedly the
                            ventriloquial sketch by Mr. O. D. Harris; in fact, it has seldom been
                            our experience to hear a better sketch of this variety off the
                            professional stage. The second part, an original farce, '"The Mummy and
                            the Mummer,” by Mr. O. D. Harris, made many of the audience wonder
                            whether we have not in this gentleman a future Pinero. All the recent
                            political and social events in Suez were cleverly brought in by the
                            young author, and we hope an occasion will soon be found to give this
                            talented young dramatist an occasion to write another local sketch.</p>

                        extraordinaires. La princesse eut le malheur de se trouver dans un accident
                        de chemin de fer, mais au lieu de perdre la téte, comme presque toutes les

                        Manchester to Egypt, our correspondent was informed that there had been, and
                        were now, delays in the discharging of cargoes at Alexandria, owing to the
                        lack of proper dock space. In some instances the delays were very serious,
                        especially in the case of vessels which had to proceed up the Syrian Coast
                        alter leaving Alexandria. The shipments to the last-named port were steadily
                        growing, the increase in the last ten years having been somewhere about
                        fifty per cent, and it was absolutely necessary, in the interests of the
                        country generally, that steps should be taken as promptly as possible for
                        affording proper facilities for loading and unloading boats with despatch.
                        He was greatly pleased to find that the International Chamber of Shipping
                        had taken up the question, and hoped it would be pushed forward with
                        vigour.</p>

                    <head>A LETTER OF MOHAMED.</head>
                    <p> Cairo magazines are not often honored by newspaper notice written by learned
                        profes-ssors, but the November number of the verna-cular contemporary Hilal
                        has obtained the signal honor of a disquisition by Professor Margoliouth in
                        the latest issue to hand of the Athenaeum. The occasion was the publication
                        in the Hilal of of a photographic reproduction of the supposed original of
                        Mohamad’s letter to the “Mukaukis.” Of this document an account was given by
                        M. Belin in a letter to Reinaud, published in the Journal Asiatique for
                        December, 1854; a certain M. Etienne Barthélemy declared that he had
                        discovered it in the binding of a MS. purchased by him at Akhmim. Sir W.
                        Muir, in his 'Life of Mohamet,’ vol. i. p. lxxvii (1857), said it was
                        desirable that the genuineness of this singularly acquired document should
                        be further discussed by the scholars of Europe; and in the Zeit-schrift der
                        DM.G., x. 543 (1856), there is a brief note by Rӧdiger, who thought the
                        genuineness doubtful, yet on the whole probable. Nӧldeke, ‘Geschichte des
                        Korans’ (1860) pp. 140, 302, expressed his conviction of its genuineness:
                        "Ein Original, an dessen Echtheit nicht zu zweifeln ist" The photograph,
                        reproduced by Zaidan, was taken from the original before it went into the
                        collection of relics of the Prophet in Constantinople</p>

                            of music on the terrace of the Gouvernorat during the reception, and a
                            guard of honor saluted the consular representatives upon their arrival
                            and departure. After the recep-tion the guard marched past to the music
                            of the Lyra Band.</p>
                        <p>The whole of the proceedings were favored with most beautiful weather. A

                            march-past was perfectly executed, and the bearing of the men was smart
                            and soldiery.</p>

                        <head>“ORIENT AND OCCIDENT.”</head>
                        <p> A new publication has made its appearance under this title. It is a
                            weekly moral and religious magazine, and is to be conducted on the
                            broadest lines, as indicated by the motto adopted, “God bath made of one
                            blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth.” Part of
                            the first number is in English, a second part in English and Arabic, and
                            the remainder in Arabic only. A very ably written article, and one of
                            great general interest, is entitled ''What the West has learned from the
                            East.” Another, on “The Drink Question in Egypt,’’ is well worthy of
                            being carefully studied.</p>
                        <p>We welcome the new magazine, and heartily wish its editors the Revs.WH.T.
                            Gairdner and D.M. Thornton, every success in their attempt to rouse
                            interest in subjects of such importance as those that they propose to
                            bring to the attention of their readers. The effort is one worthy of
                            support, and should be instrumental in bridging racial enmities and
                            prejudices, or at least lessening the harm they do. So long as the fact
                            is fully recognised that it is possible to work for good quite
                            independently of religious belief, and that there is no necessity to
                            intrude dogma into efforts for the moral and social advancement of the
                            people;-- so long and no longer will efforts of this nature deserve the
                            success they seek to obtain.</p>

                    <p>de Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>L'admissdm de U laûjue anglaise aux tri­bunaux de?la IWfort .iKôüt un fiait
                        d'autant plus importait qug l'organisme mixte est ap­pelé à vivre un oo«àuu
                        nombre d’aunées encore, surtout depuis la séparation des- "bureaux de
                        publioité" de l’Administration de la Justioe, a laquelle d’ailleurs, par
                        leur essence même, iis étaient complètement étrangers. Ce qui re­tardera
                        encore davantage la chute de œtte institution, et la fera survivre aux
                        autres créa­tions mixtes, c'est la difficulté de la reniptaCei\ Soulever la
                        question de l’abrogation des capi­tulations est une maladresse sa us
                        exemple, le le pays n’étant pas encore mûr pour un change­ment aussi
                        radical. Confier aux tribunaux indi­gènes le lourd héritage que leur
                        laisserait les tribunaux Mixtes serait h l’heure actuelle une mesure
                        prématurée, malgré les progrès réalisés par ces tribunaux depuis leur
                        fondation.</p>
                    <p>D'autre part, pour exercer leur juridiction indistinctement sur toute la
                        population, l'orga­nisation des Tribunaux indigènes devrait étie modifiée,
                        surtout en ce qui couoerue les langues étrangères, qui ne sont pas admises
                        en ce mo­ment, mais qui seront toujours usitées et cou­rantes en Egypte, de
                        par la situation géogra­phique et commerciale du pays.</p>
                    <p>Dans les tribunaux dos Etats-Unis des juges européens ont été engagés pour
                        juger les étrangers. Les différentes langues européennes sont aussi admises
                        dans certaines localités. Le ^système est suivi pour ce qui oonceme la
                        po­lice et la justice sommaire en Alsace-Lorraine et ailleurs.</p>
                    <p>Cette constatation en faveur des langues étrangères est un argument de plus
                        pour justi­fier l'admission de l’anglais dans les cours de justice. Cette
                        langue est, d’ailleurs, devenue presque indispensable &amp; la suite du
                        grand développement qu'elle a pris dans le pays, par la multiplication des
                        sociétés et. maisons de commerce britanniques, par l'importance du commerce
                        de l'Egypte avec l'Angleterre et enfin par la présence d'une importante
                        oolouio anglaise qui vient chaque hiver accroître le nombre des touristes
                        anglo-américains.</p>
                    <p>Les propositions de Lord Cromer, auxquelles la France est sur le point
                        d’adhérer, peuvent être considérées, d’ores et déjà, comme un fait accompli.
                        On objectera, peut-être, qu’il e$t dif­ficile d’imposer aux magistrats ia
                        connaissance de quatre langues judiciaires. Mais combien;y a-t-il de juges
                        européens qui connaissent l'A­rabe, qui est pourtant une langue judiciaire!—
                        Il y en a aussi qui comprennent fort peu l'Ita­lien et le Français. En teras
                        cas ceux qui con­naissent l'Anglais sont assez nombreux et le nombre des
                        greffiers possédant cette langue au Tribunal Mixte d'Alexandrie est assez
                        im­portant.</p>

                    <p>Nous extrayons de ""l'Exportation Française'' un intéressant article sur
                        l'Egypte, en taut que débouché</p>
                    <p>Il y a actuellement en Egypte nombre de débouchés dont les exportateurs ne
                        devraient pas se désintéresser. La prospérité croissante et l'accroissement
                        de la population ont donné naissance à toute une série de projets pour la .
                        distraction et la récréation du public. A Alex­andrie, on se propose de
                        construire dans le Fort-Rit, deux jetées-promenades en fer. Ces I jetées
                        seront arrangées de la même mauière que les stations baluéaires ordinaires.
                        La Mu­nicipalité fait tracer un grand parc dans les faubourgs de la ville et
                        la Compagme des Tram­ways d'Alexandrie a obtenu la permission de construire
                        une nouvelle ligne de tramways allant jusqu’à ce parc.</p>
                    <p>Des demandes de concessions ont été faites pour la construction de casinos,
                        l'un à l'extré­mité de la jetée dans le port de l’Est, l'autrq, à Mariout,
                        qui est un nouveau faubourg.</p>
                    <p>Le chemin de fer de Mariout qui est la pro­priété du Khédive, doit être
                        prolongé jusqu’au centre de La ville. Une compagnie à laquelle serait
                        intéressée la "Société Egyptienne des Etudes et Travaux'' est en formation
                        pour la construction d’un casino avec bains, restaurant et club, à
                        Port-Saïd. La même compagnie a demandé la concession de tramways électriques
                        qui iront du casino dans toutes les parties de la ville. A Tantah, Menchaoui
                        Pacha, le plus riche propriétaire foncier de la contrée, a décidé de faire
                        construire un grand théâtre dans le goût le plus moderne et on parle de la
                        construction d'un nouveau tbôfttre au Caire. Il existe plus d’un projet
                        d’hôtel pour le Caire, et à Alexandrie, on s'est décidé à construire un
                        hôtel de premier ordre à la station terminas des ohemius de fer électriques
                        de Ramleb. Le trafic de ces chemins de 1er augmente dans une telle
                        proportion qu'on va être obligé de conrtoander un grand nombre de voitures
                        en plus pour suffire aux besoins, l’été prochain. Il se pourrait que la même
                        compagnie achetât des rails.</p>

                        seats, designed to give the long, long pull which sjiells victory in a race,
                        are veritable works of art. Sp, in their way are the House-boats whioh
                        wealthy families use as Summer Homes, resting here a week,' there a month or
                        more, on the Banks of the Thames. And most of’all they congregate at
                        Henley.</p>
                    <p>A UtnUy House-Boat.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the eyes of all England are on Henley every year gives special
                        interest to the words ot a Henley man, Sir. Charles Sarney, in a local
                        paper. Pour years ago, ween he was lying helpless in Reading Hospital with
                        para­lysis and spiual disease, Mr. Sanity thought bo would never be able to
                        handle oar or scull again. For the hospital authorities told him he was
                        incurable, aud sent lor his friends to take him away.</p>
                    <p>‘•But," said Mr. Sarney (whose home is at Royal Oak Cottage, Gniy's-road,
                        Henley), "I read in a newspaper of a mau, afflicted like myself, who had
                        been completely restored to health by Dr. Williams’ pink pills for pale
                        people."</p>
                    <p>“Why don’t you try them 1’’ asked a friend.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sarney did try them, and their effect was extraordinary. Before ho had
                        finished one box be could actually walk round the table with the aid of a
                        stick. This was after months aud months in bed. After he had got partly
                        through the second box he weut lor a short walk I His friends were amazed to
                        see him out, aud asked him what he had t^keu to bring about such a
                        marvellous recovery. He told them, and gladly, that it was owing to I)r.
                        Williams’ pink pills that he was able to get out of doors again. After the
                        third box be was able to throw away bis stick. He persevered with tlie^piUs,
                        aud when he had taken eight boxes he was looking for work, after nineteen
                        months without doing a single stroke.</p>
                    <p>This is a remarkable cure, but there is no difficulty in explaining it.
                        Paralysis is a disease of the nervous system, it is a sign that the nerves
                        are ill-nounshed. The food ot the nerves is blood. l)r. Williams' pink pills
                        for pale people make new blood. Ordinary mediciue could not cure Mr. Sarney;
                        Reading Hospital was perfectly right in sending him away as incurable by
                        ordinary medicine. Dr. Williams' pink pills have cured thousands of persons
                        whom ordinary medicine could not benefit, because ordinary medicine does not
                        make new blood. Any ailment that arises from lack of blood, or lrom
                        poisoned, impure blood, as annmia, skin diseases, eczema, chronic
                        erysipelas, rheumatism, gout, can be speedily cured by Dr. Williams’ pink
                        pills; and disorders arising indirectly from lack of blood, as neuralgia,
                        spinal disease, indigestion and bile (which are caused by the blood not
                        being able to absorb food from the stomach) can be cured in the same way.

                            your columns relating to the deplorable destruction ot valuable
                            archa-ological finds at Aboukir, as also the report of the trial in your
                            issue of 5th inst (Prince Omar Pasha Tonssoun versus Mr. Richmond, iu
                            which the former was non suited in his claim of preemption), may serve
                            to direct the attention of the Government, and also of the public, to
                            this district.'</p>
                        <p>Until within the last few years, oertain native families of Aboukir and
                            Kharaba had for generations exercised proprietary rights over the
                            surroucdiug country, and sales of land had now and again been effected
                            by them.</p>
                        <p>The only part ft whioh they did not lay claim were the hills near the
                            forts, whioh were looked upon as Government property, and it is on one
                            of these hills oloee to a fort that the remains of the temple were
                            unearthed.' It would be interesting to know how these natives have been
                            dispossessed of such a large tract of oountry, and if all thfe wells and
                            roads are also to be absorbed by the new claimant to these lands.</p>
                        <p>The whole matter requires investigation, and ventilation, on Ins we are
                            to believe that, as in ths good 6U1 days ot oppression aud corruption,
                            so in these present days of progress and enlightenment:—</p>

                        <p>Sir,—“Humanity" quotes from Mr. Lang Anderson’s paper on “Land Values in
                            Bgypt” some remarks about infant mortality, and thinks if the figures
                            are true Government ‘should investigate the causes of this terrible ,
                            waste of human life.’ I happen to have come ar.-o>s Dr. Engel Bey’s
                            mortality statistics for ths towns of Lower Egypt for the 5-year period
                            from 1806-1890. For 100 births there are 71*7 deaths, as follows ,</p>
                        <p>Age 0 to 1 year 24.8 1 to 5 years 21.1 5 to 10 „ 25.8***MAKE TABLE</p>
                        <p>These figures bear out Mr. Lang Anderson’s statement that “roughly
                            one-third of the deaths are ot childreir> under 1 year, another third of
                            children^ from)l to 5 years.”</p>
                        <p>It would be reassuring if someone with later statistics would show the
                            present rate for towns, and also for the oountry generally.</p>

                        <p>Sir,— I quite agree with Professor Sayce as to the existing discreditable
                            spelling of Arabio names, but the solution is not quite so simplfe as
                            Professor 8ayoe assumes. “Shari’el-Qishlaq,” which Professor Bayoe gives
                            as the oorreot transliteration of the name of a street near the British
                            Agency, is just as much a philological horror to a Frenchman as “Chareh
                            el-Kochlak," the adopted spelling, is to an Englishman. The same forms
                            and oombinations,bath consonantal and vowel, represent different sounds
                            in different languages, and it is therefore im­possible to secure
                            universal approval for any national mothod of transliteration. All
                            attempts at an international system are mere com­promises, which satisfy
                            nobody, and are far from being “scientific transliterations," as
                            Professor Sayce would have us believe. A scientific transliteration
                            could be secured only by the adoption of a special alphabet similar in
                            form to the Latin letters, bnt corresponding phonetically to the Arabio
                            characters ; bat 1 feel sure that Professor Sayoe has no idea of
                            recommending this solution. What I think he wishes is to see an English
                            system of translite­ration universally substituted for the French
                            system, without consideration for the suscepti­bilities of those who do
                            not understand English. Perhaps, after all, this would be the easiest
                            solution.</p>
