                    <head>THE WAR OF THE FUTURE.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday’s telegrams container! a significant announcement of the opinion of
                        the American Press as to the inevitableness of the war be¬tween Japan and
                        the United States. The trouble has only just commenced, hut as the 1
                        Spectator" remarks in an article on the subject it may rapidly become
                        serious. The yellow peoples are very proud and very sensitive.</p>
                    <p>They do not acknowledge—as, for example the negroes have hitherto done—that
                        there are any inherent inequality between themselves and the white men ;
                        and, not acknowledging it, the weight of argument is entirely upon their
                        side. They do not even understand why their "intrusion" is disliked, and
                        they see their way to reprisals which might in certain contingencies—-as,
                        for instance, a great Euro¬pean war—develop into active hostilities. The
                        subject should therefore be dealt with before the Governments have caught
                        fire, and while the classes which are not affected in- both sets of
                        countries are prepared to listen to reasonable argument.</p>
                    <p>That argument should, we think, be based upon the assumption, that the races
                        will, for the present at all events, do well to keep apart. Their
                        instinctive hostility—or shall we say jealousy?- may, and probably will
                        gradually die away; but it has lasted for ages, and has become in the course
                        of those ages one of the fixed conditions of thought end feeling among the
                        masses, making a just equality of treatment for the moment nearly
                        impossible. The Far Eastern States, for example, cannot confine their
                        »migration to families only, and families of the I test character, while the
                        white States cannot coerce their uneducated populations into accept¬ing
                        their yellow competitors as friends and helpers. The movement, if it became
                        general, must inevitably develop small industrial civil wars; and
                        diplomatists may on that ground alone use all their energies to prevent by
                        agree-ment what must otherwise prove a disturbing contact, in the absence of
                        which peace between the races might reign for ages.</p>
                    <p>But, the diplomatists will ask with reason, on what lines are we to suggest
                        agreements I They will be difficult to arrange, hut they are not altogether
                        impossible As we understand the matter, none of the Far Eastern Govern-ments
                        are particularly anxious that their subjects should emigrate. On the Other
                        hand, Europeans and Americans of the working class do not seek the Far
                        Eastern States as places for settlement. It must therefore be possible for
                        the Governments on both sides to discourage emigration; and, for instance,
                        the Government of India now does whenever the demand comes from pièces which
                        it considers unsuitable under the prevailing conditions, or unwhole- some by
                        reason of climate. That Government has once or twice used its reserved power
                        to control emigration in a very decided way, once nearly milling the colony
                        of Réunion, for exam¬ple, which depended upon« supply of Indian labour, when
                        it suspected or knew that the emigrants, under a delusion about the danger
                        from cholora, were being-harshly treated These government once made, the
                        question would be under the official control of the responsible Governments,
                        who might, by intro¬ducing a passport system, prevent over-nume¬rous
                        immigration without preventing, or even restricting, the ordinary movements
                        of com¬merce or shipping. They could pass all traders' agents or bagmen,
                        while forbidding coolies to lie taken on hoard. Diplomatists may easily make
                        better suggestions than this, but this is the object they should seek, and
                        seek now, before overwhelming demand or habit of .'migration renders
                        "precautions hopeless, or so burdensome to great “interests" that the
                        Foreign Offices would try to longer retain a free hand. They may rely on it
                        that it will be many years, perhaps many decades, before the jea¬lousy of
                        the white workmen will subside; while it is most, unreasonable to expect
                        that the For Eastern populations, which are so steadily claiming their place
                        in the arrangements of the world, will for ever bear to see their children
                        insulted and injured because of an abstract theory that their presence is
                        injurious to alien civilizations, For the moment the Foreign (Justices may
                        imagine that the East can make no effective reprisals, and therefore they
                        may neglect the subject ; but that is an illusion resembling that of the
                        Russian statesmen who fancied, before the war, that Japan was a little Bower
                        which, even if it felt affronted, could he safely defied or coerced. These
                        States are not minor Bowers, but are as sensitive as if they were; and if
                        affronted, they may find means of asserting themselves which will produce a
                        sense, if not of dismay, at least of perplexity in very great Governments
                        indeed.</p>

                    <p>HARBOUR IMPROVEMENTS.-</p>
                    <p>PROGRESS OF A GREAT WORK.</p>
                    <p>Considerable progress has been made of late in the great works intended to
                        improve the accommodation of the port of Alexandria. The four most important
                        undertakings are : (1) the insurance of the outer harbor at the cost of L.E.
                        120,000 by prolonging the great break water and by throwing out a breakwater
                        From the new cattle port quay; f2) thpcoo- dtrnotion of three new timber
                        quays for six ships ; (3) the construction of a new coal quay for eight
                        ships;, (4) the construction of the Arsenal quay with berths for four ships
                        ; (5) the creation of a new pass capa¬ble of allowing tho largest commercial
                        steamer to pass safley in and out of the port in all weathers, and, in
                        conjunction with the existing pass, to provide an alternative exit and
                        egress, in ease of a block in one of them. We will deal with the present
                        state of each of these works in the order given above.</p>
                    <p>THE BREAKWATER</p>
                    <p>The two branches of the breakwater will be each 450 metres in length. The
                        extension from the land side, which juts out from the quarantine pail port,
                        has only just begun to be made, and will not be finished before May 1st,
                        1908. The work on the prolongation of the great breakwater began last
                        August, and already one hundred metres op to the level of the sea have been
                        built. Three hundred metres have been constructed to a distance of three
                        mrtres below sea level. The whole extent of this branch will be complete
                        next November.</p>
                    <p>TIMBER QUAYS</p>
                    <p>The new quays for the timber ships are situated between the Kamarieh harbonr
                        and the graving dock The embankments are complete op to the beginning of the
                        molos, and a hundred metros of the first mole are finished.</p>
                    <p>A million cubic metres of earthworks have been executed, and a thousand block
                        of concrete, twelve cubic metres each. are ready to be placed in position.
                        All the three quays will be finished and ready to receive ships by the 1st
                        March, 1908.</p>
                    <p>COAL QUAYS</p>
                    <p>Two berths of the new coal quays were finished last March. A third berth was
                        com¬pleted in December last, and a fourth last month The fifth berth will be
                        ready by-next August. The three other berth«, of the total of eight, will be
                        ready by the 1st January, 1909. The construction of the new timber and coal
                        quays is most necessary to prevent the in further congestion of the port. In
                        1895, 615.000 tons of coal wore imported. In 1905 this figure rose to 1,132
                        635 tons, and last year to 1,109,754 tons. Thu value of the wood imported in
                        1895 was L.E . 496,030. It, 190.5 the wood imports amounted to L.B.
                        1,329,219 in value.</p>
                    <p>ARSENAL QUAY</p>
                    <p>Two berths, together with the sheds, will be handed over by the engineer on
                        the 1st January next. Two others will be completed by the first June 1908.
                        The site of the old jetty attached to this quay, which was made in 1810. has
                        already been partly dredged, and 200.000 square 'Cubic metres of embankment
                        have been constructed there. The old walls will be utilized for the
                        works.</p>
                    <p>THE NEW PASS</p>
                    <p>Vessels will be able to use the now pass from next July. The advantage of the
                        new pass, in view of the continual increase in the size of commercial
                        steamers, is obvious. Although, in perfectly smooth water, tho largest
                        commercial steamer. When in light draught not exceeding 28 feet, might enter
                        the port with safety, they could not do so if laden with cargo, or during
                        bad weather ,and, in any case, might, after enter¬ing, be indefinitely
                        detained in the port until they could leave with safety. All these difficult
                        tasks will he things of the past by next July. The work has necessitated
                        considerable labour. Two hopper barges, a dredged, and a tug I arrived last
                        year for the enterprise. dredged total cost was about L.E. 50,060 and they
                        wore supplied by Symouds of Reufrew. The British Admiralty lent the Egyptian
                        Government two powerful rook dredgers They have been at work for some time,
                        and have nearly finished the new pass. The Admiralty dredgers have
                        contributed greatly to the economy of the undertaking, and have proved them
                        elves admirably adapted for the work, making it impossible to dispense with
                        the delay and expense of blasting operations. </p>

                        own staff. The object of the party is to further explore for the extinct
                        mammalia discovered by the Geological Bur vey in 1902, and recently
                        described by Mr. C. U. Andrews, of the British Museum. The most widely known
                        of the fossils ate the small an ancestors of the elephants and the large
                        horned quadrupeds named Arsinrctheria fter the ancient Egyptian Queen

                    <p>On Sunday afternoon, the children of Mr. Alexander Alderson, of Ramleh, while
                        driving with their governess and nurse, were precipitated into the
                        canal-drain ty the side of the road leading from the Mahraoudieh Canal to
                        Sidi Gaber. It is supposed that the wheel of the sakieh frightened one of
                        the horses, which fell, dragging the other horse and the carriage down the
                        steep side of the drain (a drop of about four metres). The occupants of the
                        carriage all rolled into the dirty, muddy water. Fortunately, the nurse
                        retained her hold of the baby, and those were the wily ones not com-pletely
                        immersed. 0 1 being polled oat by tho coachman (who behaved splendidly
                        throughout) has oh'ldrou failed, for the moment, to re-ogoise each other, so
                        hjsmeared were they with mud. It is a matter fur congratulation that so
                        little harm was done by what might have been a very serious acidenta, for,
                        had the arriage pinned its occupants beneath it, it is difficult to see how
                        all could have been saved. As it was, beyond a slight bruise sustained by
                        the ooaohman and a good deal of damage to tho carriage, no ono was any the

                        the' moment of the accident Dr. Beytzand Mr. Nowan Antone were driving past
                        and kindly took the dripping, mud-stained party home in their carriages.</p>
                    <p>We hear that the Municipality has had the orientation of covering this drain
                        for some time. This is now the second accident that has occur¬red at this
                        spot, and it is some satisfaction Io know that the work is to be began at
                        once.</p>

                    <p>QUESTION OF NEW SITE.</p>
                    <p>Sooner or later the present site of the Alexandria Sporting Club will have to
                        be changed, for owing to the great rise in the value of building land in the
                        immediate neighborhood of the city the site will become too valuable to
                        remain in its present condition. The discussion of the pros and coos of this
                        question has again come forward and a great deal of support is being given
                        in favor of Soof. There is a considerable extent of un¬occupied laud there,
                        and as it is near San Stefano and the Palace of the Khedivial Mother, it
                        cannot be considered too far from Ramleh for the purpose.</p>
                    <p>Prince Omar Pasha Toolson, who is the president of the Alexandria Sporting
                        Club, is in favor of the Sioux scheme, and it is anp ported by many local
                        sportsmen, who consider that the project of transferring the A. 8. C. to
                        Naught is to be deprecated claiming the space there is too cramped for a
                        good race¬course. Moreover, Nouxha is too out-of- the- way for both the
                        inhabitants of Ramleh as well as the Alexandrians and aff ords none of the
                        advantages of Soof for the reaction of a splendid hippodrome. The latter is
                        only a quarter of an hour from Alexandria by motor¬car and is convenient of
                        access from tho R imleh line. The wide stretch of open country there is fat
                        more suitable tor a racecourse than the umbrageous park-like gardens of
                        Nouxha. Those beautiful gardens and delightful walks would have to be
                        hopelessly maned to make win for a race course and all the other ape-
                        appurtenances of a Sporting Club.</p>
                    <p>Another alternative scheme is the Badura Lakeside. The lake would have to be
                        drain¬ed, which would not be a very difficult task, and the site is
                        convenient. But it may well be argued that in years to come, owing to the
                        enormous expansion of A exedra towards the east, this site will be in time
                        found to fall a prey to the builder just as is the existing site. No snob
                        objection can be urged against the Ohio of Sioux. In such a case as the
                        selection of a new site for the Alexandria Sporting Club it is most
                        necessary to look as far forward as possible, and from this point of view
                        the Sioux site is unexceptionable.</p>
                    <p>Orb exhalent confrere the "Pare d’ Alex- Andrei" recently published an
                        interesting article on this question, and strong'; supported the schema of
                        Prince Omar Pa h t Toussaint. His Highness’s idea is also, in our opinion, a
                        very happy one, and deserves local support. Sooner or later the new site of
                        the Alexandria Sporting Club will have to be chosen, and tho sooner a
                        definite decision is arrived at the better for the lab and its members.
                        Prince Omar is to be congratulated on raising the question, and we hope that
                        his idea will receive the support that it merits.</p>

                    <p>The R. M. S. Isis arrived hare this afternoon from England after having
                        undergone repairs and will take her usual ran with the Brindisi mail next
                        week. The 8.8. Peninsular, which has been carrying the mails doing the
                        absence of the Isis, will, after transferring the mail on Wednesday,
                        continue her journey to Bombay, where she will resume her usual run.</p>
                    <p>There was a ‘Bachelors’ Ball" at the Eastern Exchange last Friday. This boing
                        the first English dance this season, there was a good attendance, and a very
                        enjoyable evening was passed.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday the Port Said Club gave one of their delightful balls in the club
                        rooms. About 150 guests were present, among whom we noticed H.E. the

                        was kept up till after 4.80 a.m.</p>

                    <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE ' Egyptian GAZETTE " Sir,—With reference to 'Casual
                        Observer's" letter dated January 29 on this subject, I beg to say that I
                        have no desire to add an ought to any of the figures contained in my letter
                        of the 28th. Since writing my last letter I have enquired of Mr. Preston as
                        to the actual weights of the girders and joists used in the construction of
                        the College and out- buildings and am informed that the exact quantity is
                        454 tons, and not 10,000, IS estimated by "Casual Observer,” so that my
                        estimate was not far off tho correct amount.</p>
                    <p>I am pleased to think that I am sufficiently advanced in my profession to be
                        able to distinguish between hundreds and thousands of tons, which Bourns to
                        be beyond the power of a mere ''Casual Observer."—Yore truly,

                    <p>Sir,—When you pay your visit to the office of the hen. see. of the Victoria

                    <p>EAST AND WEST.</p>
                    <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,— At the banquet that was held in honor of Mr. Robert on,. M.P., Mr.
                        Dicey is reported to have said the following, which I translate from “Al
                        Minibar" : —</p>
                    <p>‘The longer I stay in your bountiful country which I consider a second home
                        to me ( I 1 I) I become convinced that between East and West there is a
                        great abyss that cannot be roosted from either side."</p>
                    <p>In other words, he reiterates the two notorious lines of Kipling’s :</p>
                    <p>East is East, and West is West,</p>
                    <p>The twain she’ll I ever meet.</p>
                    <p>In answer I beg to refer Mr. Dioecy to the following excerpt from "A People
                        In School,” by More Fielding Hall, if I remember correctly. She says :
                        “There is no such thing as the Oriental mind, it. is only an expense for all
                        dullness.”? In other words, E.st and West are a twain that may and will
                        meet, and they have already met in favor of the former—the war o' Russia and
                        Japan are not far away from us.</p>
                    <p>— Yours truly, </p>

                    <p>The second annual general meeting of mem¬bers of the British Club,
                        Alexandria, was held on Saturday night’, and was well attended. The accounts
                        for 1906 were passed, and the hon. treasurer’s statement of the financial
                        position of the lung was considered satisfactory. The rules, with slight
                        modifications, were confirmed, and the following were elected to term
                        together with 'he Finance Committee, which remains in force for two more
                        years, the General Committee for 1907: Messrs. A. R Brown, T F Donovan, J G

                        and the Rev. A. H. Longley. M . W F Sa-jeaiit was elected chairman, and Mr.
                        P. W. Carver re¬elected hon. treasurer. The appointment of hon secretary was
                        left to the General Comitten, who met later on and elected Mr. W. J

                    <head>BRITISH RECREATION CLUB</head>
                    <p>A highly successful smoking concert was held in the British Recreation Club,
                        Cairo, on Saturday 2nd inst. A large and varied programme was submitted and
                        carried through with every sign of appreciation on the part of a full
                        attendance. Panototre selections by Private James and Mr. C, Summers, cello
                        solos by Band Sargeant Geogehegan, and violin solos by Bandsman Hobbs, were
                        rendered with taste and feeling- and especially so this applies to the celo
                        solos of Sergeant Geoghegan, who showed the touch of a master in all his
                        efforts- and the repeated calls for encores to these artists proved their
                        acceptance to the audience. Private Parrington, in his songs, "The Toilers:
                        and :big Ben," Mr. Allen, in "walking out with Angelina: and "My Havannah
                        Queen," Mr. S Ades in "I love you in velvet" and "The man behind", and Mr
                        Carins in "what did I do?" and "Stop yer tickling' Jock," were enjoyable
                        items, which were received with approbation and recalled in every instance.
                        Trooper Fairclough showed his versatility in a skirt dance, the execution of
                        which and his dress and general "get-up" revealed a close study of the music
                        hall skirt dancer. Sapper Goodwin, in his songs, I'll be up your way next
                        week" and "Ding Dong" literally "brought down the house" the former
                        especially being received with uproarious mirth; his song following these,
                        "The song that will live forever," proved him and equally capable artist
                        even in a more serious vein. Piper McConnaschie and Day aroused the
                        enthusiasm of the audience to a high pitch by a stately and dignified
                        rendering of the sword to Piper McConnaschie's dancing, and to repeated
                        calls they gave a combined selection of the bagpipes including a march
                        ("Barren Rocks O'Aden") strathspey ("Miss Drummond of Perth") and reel ("My
                        wooers be merry"). AN enjoyable evening culminated with "God save the King."
                        A word of praise is due to Mr. C. Summers, the moving spirit of the
                        entertainments committee, who worked indefatigably in organizing the smoker,
                        and not only found time to well marshal his musical forces, but to
                        contribute personally to the programme.</p>
