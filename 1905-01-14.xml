                        <p>A report dated the 12th inst. states that on Wednesday morning the
                            Japanese cavalry en­countered four Russian squadrons at Tang- masa,
                            south west of Liao-yang. The Russians were repulsed with heavy loss

                        <p>Two thousand Russian cavalry attacked Niu-chwang the same afternoon. The
                            Japanese retired but, being subsequently reinforced, drove off the
                            enemy, whom they were still pur­suing when the report was

                        <p>Eight Russian squadrons and an Infantry regiment, with 12 guns,

                            the 12th inst They were repulsed, losing at least 80. Steps were being
                            taken to intercept the raiders' retreat.</p>

                    <div type="item"><p>London, 7th January.</p>
                        <p>Port Arthur has fallen, and so have Russian Stocks—had it not been for the efforts of in­terested parties Russian fours would now be below 90. There were reports on ’Change this morning to the effect that the coming loan of £25,000,000, mentioned in our last, is to be postponed ; there is no doubt that the financial strain is making itself severely felt, and if the struggle in the Far East is continued much longer, the resources of more than one of the Powers will be required to prevent a serious falling away from present prices. The latest news as to the coming issue is to the effect that Russian financial authorities have decided to reduce the amount asked for in Germany to £16,000,000 — no doubt at the instigation of those who have undertaken the burden of finding the money. The bait to the under­writers is a substantial one, namely 4 1/2% com­mission, in other words, they get the stock, which it will be remembered carries interest at 4 1/2%, at 90 1/2, the issue price being 95. As regards the prospects of peace, we are assured that these are better to-day than they have been for some weeks past. The Russian people want an honorable peace and are beginning to make themselves heard in earnest. France is moving heaven and earth to help them to this end, and all the other great Powers are ready to lend a helping hand, so if the various Russian factions can only settle their differences it will not be long before the last gun in Manchuria is fired. The markets since the New Year have been somewhat disappointing. Dealers had one and all made up their minds we were to see a good recovery all round, and a large number had backed their opinions by buying stock dur­ing the last account of the year. This professional speculative buying is in itself a weak factor when outside business is on so small a scale as it has been of late. Another point tending to check any upward movement is the fact that Germany was a heavy seller during the early part of the week of speculative stocks in gene­ral and Kaffirs in particular. This may be accounted for by the feeling in Berlin as to the forthcoming issue of Russian stock referred to above. Egyptian stocks have kept clear of the general dull tone and there has been a sharp recovery in price under the lead of National Banks, which were as high as 24 bid early in the week, and are now 4 $ buyers. Agriculturals  are firm again at 9 7/8 buyers, and Daira shares are almost up to 22. Salt and Soda took a fresh start yesterday at 2, and look strong again at that figure. Delta Lands have recov­ered to 3 1/2 premium The buying comes from your side and it looks as if Egypt were trying force prices against London, but there is no to open Bear account here although there is not much stock about. The shares of the Corpora­tion of Western Egypt—dealings in which have commenced since our last — have been in fair demand at 5/8 @ 3/4 premium, but the market is only a nominal one involving negotiations if it is a question of more than a few shares. Egyptian mining shares are dull again with Kaffirs. Their definite recovery depends for the present on the activity of the mining section generally. Nile Valley close at 2 1/4 buyers and United Africans at 1 3/4, with not much doing in either.</p></div></div><cb n="2"/>

                    <p>The inquest on the late Mr. A. Bensilum was continued yesterday morning at the British Consulate, Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Herz Bey, called as a witness, took the oath and stated that the deceased was employed in
                        his office from early in 1897 to November 29, 1904. Deceased was an architect working under the Bureau du Comite des Monuments Arabes. Witness had been ill, and alter returning from Helouan on the 26th November last, found a letter from deceased tendering his resignation. He knew of no reason for this. He had received two letters from the deceased in which he excused himself for non attendance at the of­fice, giving various excuses, followed by a formal letter of resignation. He saw the de­ceased, who gave no reason and merely said that he was going to Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Questioned by the jury, witness stated that he bad not been altogether satisfied with de­ceased's work, and quoted several cases in which he had been forced to reprimand him for omissions and negligence of orders. On the last occasion deceased said he would comply with the spirit if not the letter of his in­structions. He had previously written to Dr. Sierra, an uncle of the deceased, more than once. On this occasion, when he returned to the office, which had been in deceased’s charge during absence of witness, certain things had not been done, and the clerks said they would resign if deceased was put in charge again. After bringing deceased’s conduct before the committee he wrote to Dr. Sierra, saying that he wished to speak to him about a relation. In reply to the question as to who it was, contained in Dr. Siena’s answering letter, be wrote and put the facts before him, but on receiving deceased’s letter tendering his re­signation he wired to Dr. Sierra to consider witness’s second letter as null. His report to the committee and complaints to Dr. Sierra could not have been known to deceased before be gave his resignation. Deceased’s salary was L.E. 22 ; he began at L.E. 13.</p>
                    <p>The jury brought in a verdict of suicide from despair, on which Mr. Alban, who was presiding over the inquest, asked them to consider whether deceased was compos mentis or not when he committed suicide.</p>
                    <p>The jury retired for consideration and gave a verdict of “suicide while deceased was not responsible for his actions, owing to despair at his non-success in his profession.”</p></div>

Wingate, K.C.B.,D.S.O., has just completed five years in command of the Khedive's troops, but it has been ruled that his case does not come under the provi­sions of the Royal Warrant. Be that as it may, it is certain that his removal from the head of the Egyptian Army would be a great mistake, and the Army Council was well advised in sanctioning his continuance in command.</p></div>
                    <div type="item"><p>In March Major General John R. Slade, C.B., will vacate the command of the British Amy in Egypt From accounts to hand from Cairo, the approaching retirement of the gallant gunner is contemplated with much regret by all ranks, for he has ever been popular with his subordinates and superiors, anno domino being his only enemy. His field services, we need hardly remind our readers, included that black day at Maiwand, where his noble devotedness largely went towards saving the British guns.</p></div>
                    <div type="item"><p>Major Alexander Mattei, Royal Malta Artillery, has just been promoted Lieutenant- Colonel commanding the regiment, one company of which is stationed at Alexandria. Lieutenant-Colonel Mattei, who replaces Colo­nel Antonio Gatt, retired, joined the regiment in November, 1870, and has held field rank for the past twelve years. He holds the medal and Khedive’s star for service in the Egyptian War of 1882.</p></div>
                    <div type="item"><p>Sanction has been given for the employment of Lieutenant G. F. Rugg, Royal Army Medical Corps, at Woolwich, with the Egyptian Army.</p></div>
                    <div type="item"><p>The following honors have been granted to the regiments having battalions serving in Egypt, in recognition of their services in the Boer War :— Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, “South Africa 1899-1902" and “Relief of Ladysmith;" Royal Berkshire Regiment, “South Africa 1899-1903,” and Rifle Brigade “South Africa 1890-1903,” “Defence of Lady­smith" and “Relief of Ladysmith.” It cannot be said that the Army Council has been over­lavish in distributing these honors for embla­zonment on the regimental colours and ap­pointments.</p></div>
                    <div type="item"><p>It has been decided that the 3rd and 4th Battalions added to the Northumberland Fusiliers, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, Royal Fusiliers, Lancashire Fusiliers, Worcestershire Regiment, Middlesex Regiment, and the Manchester Regiment in the past few years, will be gradually reduced, and also the five battalions of the Royal Garrison Regi­ment. So far as is practicable the officers will be transferred to other regiments. On the other hand, the establishments of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade are to be increased.</p></div>
                    <div type="item"><p>The new Reserve Fleets have just been inaugurated at Chatham, Portsmouth, and Plymouth by the commissioning of a large number of ships with nucleus crews. Close on 100 battleships, cruisers, and smaller ships have been thus commissioned under the new conditions.</p></div></div>

                        <p>Yesterday's races deserved a better attendance, for though the weather was rather raw | in the morning, in the afternoon the wind fell and the weather remained quite warm till about 5 p.m., when a little rain fell. Lord and Lady Cromer and Lady Beatrice Thynne were present at the races and among the other spectators were Major-General Slade, C.B., Coles Pasha, Mr. Webb, C.M.G., Lady Rogers, Mme. Adolphe Cattani, Hon. and Mrs. Davey,
                            Mr. Rumbold, Mr. Higgins, Col. Aylmer Johnson Pasha, Mr. P. Machell, Mr. P. de Martino, Ishak Bey Hussein, Omar Bey Sultan, and many other well-known residents. Visitors were curiously scarce.</p>
                            <p>The racing gave some very good finishes, especially in the 4th and 5th races, which were  excellently fought. In the 4th race Fitz only just beat Mizzaud, while in the 5th Starboard Light showed remarkable staying powers, just getting home past such good horses as Sir Visto and Latiff. A very unfortunate accident happened in the 2nd race, Saleh Bey Cherif's new horse, Sans Pretention, stumbling and breaking its off foreleg while rounding the turn. Khalil Pasha Khayat again did well and got two firsts, while Mr. Tueni’s Voyageur, though he, as usual, failed to win; ran quite well and was 2nd in the Novices’ Stakes. Mr. Sursock and Mr. Karam were again unlucky.</p>
                            <p>The following are the results of the various Brents:—</p>

                            <p>Aeolus jumped off at the start and led till half-way, when Latiff came up and passed him.

In the straight Latiff increased his lead and won by 2 lengths. Aeolus was second, Miasr just getting in third ahead of St Frusquin.</p>

Ca­rey and a party ot eight; Mr. Campbell and a party of nine; Mr. and Mrs. Scott-Dalgleish, with Lady Clarke and several friends, a party of eight; Baron Felix Oppenheim, from Paris, and a party of three ; Mr. G. C. Grew and a party of eight; Lady Duffey and friends ; Mr. C. Belinfante-Ostberg ; Mr. Lecomte, Colonel Garnett, Mr. and Mrs. Hutchison, and a great many others too numerous to mention. The dance was very animated and lasted till half-past one.

                <div type="item"><head>TIJK COMING OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>'.Tho material progress made in Egypt (lyr iugtbo lost twenty years, bus certainly been remarkable.” So wrote lord Croiuer to the Martinis of Lanxlownu in his last otlu-iul repofc on the tinanees, administration, an t condition if Egypt and the Sudan. And the accuracy of the statement-will, I think* l>o amply b .me out by the far-seeing financiers whose uauic- and reputation* are so closely identified with the advance of this highly favored territory. wLioh may now be regarded as within the coniines of the British Empire. But satisfied »> Lord Crouier undoubtedly is with the past, he looks forward to still more ambitious develop meals, and does not hesitate to tell its thnt "a far greater degree of prosperity is attainable in. the future.” Naturally, however, with so vain able a possession very special core must betaken nottio launch out too quickly or without due consideration. A false step at this stage might mean, if not disaster, at any rate-a set-back. Accordingly we find Lord Cromer insisting on the utmost care being taken not to embark on auy schema involving heavy expenditure until all the facts connected with tile matter are fully examined anddi cusa-'.d. N»one acquaint-, ed with Egjpt is likely to find fault with this policy. But wliilujfMUtiou is to be the natch word in opening tip the country, there is no intention of allowing things, to stagnate, aud as soon as Lord Cromer is convinced of the neces­sity and the feasibility of any project} he does not hesitate to advise the Egyptian Govern1 meat to adopt a policy of financial baldness in the direction of spending capital. This was the coofse pursued iu the construction of the Nile reservoirs, aud the same plan was! followed, with respect to the Suakin-Bexber Railway.. A similar policy has ..Vky*'ien adopted with regard to the many, demands' yor mi*ing con­cessions ill Egyjt and the •' -,'u lau , received daring the past tjo years. Wiile no obstacle* are allowed to be placed in, me way:of legiti­mate commercial enu: ,; e*s{ the mere company prouiotor is rigidly excluded. ThatLotUCromer has experienced no small difficulty in attain­ing both these objects will be easily understood, And that be has done sods a further proof of his great power as art administrator. Not only have the interests of the Egyptians themselves been his care, but by means of the policy ha- has so wisely, adopted he has also safeguarded the iuterests of the investor. His knowledge oi finance, however, has not led him into driving hard bargains; it is the genuineness of the transaction that has been ever present to. his mind, not the desire to coerce his clients info making a purchase which handicaps profits. For instance, he fully recognises that so highly a speculative business as miuing cannot be carried to a successful issue unless a large</p><cb n="1"/>
                    <p>margin of profjt is loft to the prospiotor. His 1 mission is to encourage mining enterprise, not ' to repel it by extortionate demands and exas­perating conditions.</p>
                    <p>__ JBSCEPTIONAL RESOURCES.</p>
                    <p> Nearly all the Egyptian territory j lying ' be­tween the Nile uud the Kod Sea ha-* now been allotted, in areas of.different sinea,|to private j syndicates. A rent of L.E. 2 an acre jfa charged , Ou the area taken up for winiug purposes; and a royalty of one-tenth, is levied on the annual j distributable profits arising under; or in oonnec l tiou with, the oonoession, but in the caLso of j prospecting fur col half the-above rent onlyis asked, aud the Government takes no share in the profits of the. undertaking, sincejit is well understood what an . immense advantage it would be to the country if coal iiiiaderjOate quantity oduld be found in Egypt or the Sudan. Yet while Lord Cromer lias been carry-' itig out. this Very oonsiilontble. tfunster of mineral-bearitig property, apart froi* the’poli- tjcal classes and they financiers -vyho have become the fortunate purchasers, thej majority of British people still apear tolqok ion Egypt as a country’ of deserts and pyramids? The ordinary British iuvostor is in iftifomaoe of the wealth awaiting his attention. He probabl/ kuows nothing of the reoent treaty ' arrange­ment with France,, and associates the Egypt of to-day with'the vagaries experienced in the past, rather than .with tbs firm administration qfLqwb,Cromer. It is time, then,j for the to take hie part in the dewslopment of.«Nmno’ whioh. in resource ia like^ to rival Indik-^Mfllions of acres of the roost productive •oil are ^waiting irrigation, and thiir pros­pective value may be gauged by (the large acreage already possessing this advantage. Egypt proper pays ita expenses and the interest -ou its-Uopt* and with the passing of tHe French Trp *ty a goodly portion ol the yearly surplus will be released for use on public undertakings, such a# new railways, port*, oanals, and harbour works. The Sudan ia fast racoyeringjfrom the ravages of tfio Mahdi, but funds ana aorely needed for development purposes. Aij yet.it is only by the most rigid economy that if is fonnd possible to make both ends meet. Thd Dongola Froviooe has a very large acreage suitable for ootton-growing — the banks of the Vfhite and Blue Niles will grow almost anything — while -ill for Bahr-el-Ghazal we. have a province whioh arouses even the enthusiasm of the native. All who know Egypt see the great difference ia the peasant population during the last few years. Even-handed justice is now a certainty. The Arab tribes are becoming accustomed to British rule, and are quick ^ to grasp the truism that peace means wealth and war spells poverty. Each year as the; country opens up Bedouin, Bishareen, and Hedei wa come into contact with Europeans au- ose</p><cb n="2"/>
                        <p>their dosire for fighting and robbery. In lhfed ' G6neral Gordon told us that “ the Sudan is a worthier possession, ever was so, and ever will be so.” This view was also enter­tained byi Colonel Stewart Time and British influence, have changed allptbis, and Lord Cromer, is of opinion “that without indatiring a charge, of excessive optimism it may be anticipated that, with a judicious expenditure of oapital and the continuous application of a system of government inch as that whioh is: now very skilfully directed by Sir Reginald Wingate and hie stall’, the future of the country will be far less gloomy than was predicted by these two > high authorities.” There is no doubt that the difficultiee in the way of extending the cultivable area of • the Sudan, though considerable, will be over­come in time ; -while the objections which tho -Egyptians now entertain again.vt emigra­tion to that country- will probably disappear under the influonoe of an improved admini­stration.</p>
                        <p>MINERAL WEALTH.</p>
                        <p>Tho mineral wealth must also be taken into account when reckoning up tho prospective* Vi?- lue of Egypt It is true that miioh of. the oontiiuJ try is as yet unexplored.
