                        <p>“The Filtration Works for supplying the , Town of Alexandria with Potable Water” 
                            is the subject of an interesting but highly technical pao|phlet by Mr. H. R. C.</p>
                        <p>Blag- | don, manager of the Alexandria Water Company.</p> 
                        <p>The completion of the filtration works described in this paper marks an import ant epoch 
                            in the modern history of Alexandria, and even of Egypt, as the works are the first of their kind in the country, and Alexandria
                            is the first town in Egypt to be supplied with an efficient and up-to-date filtration-system for
                            its water-supply.</p> 
                        <p>Mr. Blagden gives a very complete account of the installation and expresses his satisfaction with the Jewell filters</p> 
                        <p>It | will be remembered that in September, j 1 the Water Company and the Municipality jointly were approached by the Jeweli Export Filter 
                            Company of New York, with a view to the introduction of their system of rapid sand-filtration, but at first the suggestion 
                            was received with a good deal of opposition, not only because the slow sand-system had been practically decided upon, 
                            but also because the Water Company and the Municipality together had already spent some years in carrying out experiments 
                            on this system with some small settling-tanks and biters which had been specially made for this purpose.</p> 
                        <p>The Jewell Filter Company, however, gave extremely favourable guarantees as to 't;.e saving in first cost of the new works 
                            by the adoption of their system, and also the higher efficiency of their filters as compared with that which 
                            probably would be obtained with the slow sand-filters; they were further prepared to substantiate their guarantees by erecting, 
                            on their own responsibility and at their own expense, in Alexandria, near the Water Company's intake on the Mahmoudieh Canal, 
                            a complete model plant, includingpomps, settling- tanks, and one Jewell gravity-filter capable of delivering 22,400 
                            gallons of filtered water in 24 hours This plant was actually delivered in the following October, 
                            and the ultimate result of the trials was that these filters were selected.</p> 
                          <p>There can be no doubt, says Mr. Blagden, that, for a town like Alexandria, 
                             which is unfortunately occasionaliyGvisited by an epidemic of cholera, 
                             the Jewell system of filtration presents many great advantages over the slow sand-system.</p> 
                          <p>It requires only about one-sixth of the area of the ground required for the same daily 
                             output by the slow sand- system.</p> 
                          <p>The cleaning out and washing of the filters ia done entirely mechanically, without any 
                             handling whatever and without any man coming in contact with the filtering-sand, 
                             whereas in the slow sand-system at least thirty men would be employed in scraping the' 
                             top layer of sand in fcffe filters for cleaning purposes, and in times of epidemic 
                             there would be considerable risk of infecting the filters ; anyone who is acquainted 
                             with the extremely insanitary habits of the natives will thoroughly appreciate this point.</p> 
                          <p>The Jewell filters are contained in a covered house, and are not exposed to the hot ^un and dust ; 
                             this is an important point inEgyj^t, where masonic-work, especially cement, deteriorates and 
                             cracks very rapidly from exposure to the sun, and requires constant repairs ; all the 
                             valves and automatic regulating-apparatus are also within the filter-house, and 
                             consequently can be easily kept clean, besides being far less liable to get out of order.</p> 
                          <p>The whole of the washing of the filters can be easily done by one nrwfr, each 
                             filter occupying only 5 minutes per day in cleaning, and not only the top ayer of the 
                             filter, but the whole bed of sand, is cleaned at each washing ; the Jewell 
                             filter is also in itself an ideal sand-washing machine.</p> 
                          <p>Lastly, it can be justly claimed for the Jewell filter that it possesses an 
                             almost ideal regulator for the speed of filtration, and for the pressure; 
                             the How of filtered water is absolutely constant during the entire run, and 
                             the diagram of pressure is perfectly regular, as has been shown by constant experiment.</p> 
                          <p>This is a most important fact, as it is well known that the perfect working of a 
                             sand-filter depends entirely upon the constancy of the rate of filtration and 
                             the regularity of the increase of pressure.</p> 
                          <p>The Weston automatic controller on the outlet likewise has the advantage 
                             that the rate of filtration, in case of necessity, can be changed in a 
                             few minutes ; this is of great importance in the event of a sudden demand 
                             for an abnormal quantity of filtered water, due to an outbreak of fire or other cause.</p>
                          <p>The results, given by Mr. Blagden, leave no room for doubt as to the efficiency 
                             of the method of sedimentation and filtration ; the action of the alumina 
                             in the settling-tanks is most marked, and it has been found when cleaning 
                             out the settling-tanks that the amount of deposit remaining in the first 
                             compartment of the settling-tanks was nearly five times that in the second 
                             compartment, showing that the time allowed for sedimentation, which at present 
                             is 7 to 9 hours, is amply sufficient.</p> 
                         <p>The percentage removal of bacteria from the raw water is distinctly high, and 
                            exceeds the guarantee of the Jewell Filter Company ; the daily averages are very 
                            uniform, and never since the first month of the filter’s working has the removal of 
                            bacteria been le9s than 98 per cent.</p>

                            Casino, the fancy dress ball, which takes place tomorrow evening and promises to
                            be a huge success. Tables for dinner at the hotel that evening should be ordered
                            in advance. Guests presenting themselves in ordinary evening dress will be called upon,
                            on entrance to the ball, to pay the sum of P.T. 40, and all such fines will be landed over 
                            to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

                            <p>The inauguration took place on Friday last of the large brick, tile, and plaster works
                            erected by Mr. Sornago at El Wady, near Kafr Ammar, which may be considered as among the best
                            equipped and largest works of the kind in existence. Among those who attended the inaugural
                            ceremony were Lord and Lady Cromer, Commendstore Malmusi,Italih Minister, accompanied by the staff

                            <p>Dr Dauanbour Correspondent sends us the following further details of the murder of thegent
                            of Boghos Pasha Nubar near Damanhou. On the night of the tragedy the victim was sitting in his house
                            surrounded by his family at the time of his death and was actually playing with his youngest child, whom
                            he was dandling on his knee. Suddenly the repeat of firearms was heard, and he received two bullets in 
                            his head. The murderers demped. On the following morning, the modir and the niabeh left for the scene of 
                            the tragedy and after a careful enquiry two Arenians were arrested. On Saturday Mourees Be left for the
                            ezbet accompanied by the two accessed, whom he ultimately released as no pro of their guilt could be adduced. 
                            O y the affir of the ezbet will be brought up for trial.</p>

                    <subhead> The Reported Raids.</subhead>
                    <p> We understand that there is no foundation in the report that the Egyptian Bedouins have suffered from Turkish attacks 
                        in the frontier district. The Awakir tribe, who inhabit the hinterland of Barka, have undoubtedly committed depredations 
                        on the Bedouins who are under Egyptian rule, but there is no reason whatever to suppose that the Turkish Government is 
                        in any way responsible for the acts of this lawless and turbulent tribe and its chief, Sheikh Abdel Kader el Kozza.
                    <p> It is hoped that the oommission which left yesterday for Benghazi, and whioh includes representatives of the aggrieved 
                        tribe, will make a satisfactory settlement of the questions at issue between the Egyptians and the Tripoli Bedouins. 
                        The Turkish authorities are certainly most unlikely to put any difficulties in their way.</p>

                            edition, “L’Etendard Egyptien,’’ will appear in the afternoon. These newspapers will shortly make their debut, and their 
                            publication is only temporarily postponed in order to get extra material from Europe. In yesterday’s issue of “Al Lewa” 
                            Mustapha Pasha Kamel publishes an impressive appeal to all native literati who are conversant with the English and French 
                            languages to rally round his “Standard” and urges them "to draw their pens in order to defand the hallowed rights and

                        <p> “The time has now come,” explains the Pasha, "when the whole world should hearken to the cries of Egypt and the claims

                    <p> The accounts for 1906, which showed a credit balance of P.T. 4833.8 were passed. On the recommendation of the committee 
                        it was decided to build a wing on to the west side of the existing house and to adopt plans prepared by Mr. Robert Williams, 
                        at an estimated expenditure of about £1,250, towards which sum donations have been received or promised amounting to abont £l00.</p>
                    <p>The following were elected on the committee for 1907 : Messrs. E B. Gould, G.B. Alderson, S H. Carver, E.W.P. Foster, J.E. Cornish,

                    <p> Mr. Gould announced the resignation of Miss Waeber from the post of matron on account of ill health, and in a few well chosen words 
                        recalled the devoted services which Miss Waeber had rendered to the Home during her four years' tenure of office, during which 
                        time the Home had very greatly improved in efficiency. He pointed out that Miss Waeber possessed all the qualities required in a 
                        matron, and added that she takes with her in her retirement the very highest appreciation of her services by the committee.</p>
                    <p> A vote of thanks to Miss Waeber for her very valuable services was unanimously accorded, and the meeting terminated with a

                    <p>As was to be expected, the subscription for shares in Caffari’s Co-operative Markets has proved a great success, the 
                        amount offered to the public having been covered several times over during Friday and Saturday. In fact, so many 
                        have been the applications that the directors have generously consented to allot some of the shares they had reserved 
                        for themselves.</p>
                    <p> We mentioned in a former issue of our paper the many advantages offered to the public in dealing with these stores. 
                        The foremost is the convenience of being able, by one walk through the extensive premises in Sharia Kasr-el-Nil, to 
                        procure all one’s household requirements in one place and, what is still more important, be sure of getting 
                        everything of the best quality and at the most moderate price.</p>
                    <p> The career of the founder of this business is a striking example of what can he accomplished by dint of hard work 
                        combined with perseverance and strict integrity. Mr. J. B. Caffari began his career in this country as a broker 
                        on the Alexandria Bourse in 1881 in conjunction with the late Mr. Camilleri. In the following year he became agent 
                        in Egypt for Messrs. Butler amp Co., army contractors, afterwards known as Butler and Bencini. He remained with this
                        firm until 1846 when he started business in this city on his own account and the next year opened branches in Cairo 
                        and Crete. The business in Cairo increased so rapidly that Mr. Caffari found it neccesary to remove in 1903 from the 
                        Esbekieh quarter to the present premises in Sharia Kasr-el-Nil, which were considerably enlarged last year, and the
                        daily sales of the establishment have now attained no less than £50, which can be considered a record figure for a 
                        concern of his description in Egypt. Like most of the world's big stores, this one aslo started with modest beginnings,
                        and as we mentioned before, owes its marvellous success to the one great principle, initated by the late Mr. Whiteley, 
                        of Westbourne Grove fame, of selling sound and reliable goods at the smallest possible profit. The success of this flotation 
                        should be a proof to our local financiers that sound industrial undertakings in this country can be turned into companies 
                        with as much case as in the case of land, building, and similar concerns.</p>

                    <p>A few days ago the Union Fonciere d'Egypte refused an offer of L.E. 101 per feddan for the thousand feddans of its property in
                    the Gharbieh province, which it had originally purchased for L.E. 52 per feddan. The company was well advised to refuse this offer 
                    as it is now selling this land in lots at an average rate of L.E. 110 per feddan and there is great keennees amoung the fellaheen to 
                    buy at this price.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the irHux of gold, which is in great part still in the villages, the demand for agricultural land as an investment by the
                    fellaheen is becoming more marked every day and the Union Fociere is receiving offers at excellent prices continually. For example, the 
                    other day it received an offer for its land at Kafr Shargi, in the Gharbieh province, at the rate of L.E. 70 per feddan for 700 feddans.
                    The company purchased this land only a few months ago for L.E. 45 per feddan. Other offers have been received at the rate of L.E. 70 per 
                    feddan for land purchased from the Behera Company L.E. 40.</p>
                    <p>The Union Fonceire will close its first balance sheet on the 15th proxo., which will cover eighteen months' working as the company was

                    <p>(From Our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Luxor, February 8.</p>
                    <p>Upper Egypt is just now being invaded by an army of visitors from every part of the civilised 
                    world, and Luxor is experiencing such an influx as has never before been known. The hotels are filled 
                    to overflowing, and, judging by the advance bookings for rooms and for berths on the steamers, the season
                    of 1907 looks like being a long one.</p>
                    <p> Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir Ernest Cassel passed through this week on their way further South, 
                        while Lord Cromer is expected here shortly.</p>
                    <p>The dahabeah contingent is much to the fore just now, and the little flest moored on both sides of
                    the river adds greatly to the life and interest of the scene. The Miriam, Bedouin, and Nephthis are still
                    at their customary moorings, but the Gazelle has left for the South, while the Arabia, Serapis, and Scarab,
                    have passed through once more on their homeward journey.</p>
                    <p>Amongst well-known people making a stay at the Winter Palace are Lord and Lady Halsbury, the Baronne de Foret,
                    Sir J. Hamilton Lang and family, the Hon. Alexander Yorke, C.V.O., Sir Robert Dashwood, and many others.</p>
                    <p>The Tuesday dances at this hotel are proving very popular. Several of the passengers from the tourist steamers
                    responded to the invitation of the manager last Tuesday, as well as visitors from the other hotels.</p>
                    <p>The Gymkhanas, on Thursdays, are also well patronised, and always fo with a smoothness and rapidity that tell
                    of long cooperation on the part of the commitee. This week there were the usual races for natives, the donk y boys'
                    race (face to tail and bare back) being perhaps the most popular with the spectators, while the visitors' events
                    consisted of (1) a donkey race for ladies and gentlemen, won by Miss Thompson, M. A. Found being a good second
                    and (2) a goolah begging race in which Mr. C. Warnes was first and Dr. J Garner second.</p>
                    <p>After a week of cold winds and somewhat low temperature for this region, the weather is once more warm and gentle, 
                    and Luxor is maintaining its high recognation for sunshine and equability.</p>

                    <p>Miss Critten has but a small audience at the first of her "One-hour recitals" at Shepheards on Friday night, but 
                    there was not one among that audience who was not fully impressed by the dramatic talent she displayed. In addition
                    to her wonderful memory and pleasing voice Miss Critten possesses a fine sense of humour and an instinct for effect
                    which would have served her in good stead had she only chosen the stage as her profession. Her recitations, or 
                    impersonations, or whatever she likes to call them, are really delightful little studies of character, and the play of 
                    feature and action in company with her wonderfullly sympathetic voice are singularly attractice. As raconteuse or teller 
                    of short stories, too, she is excellent, never losing the point of her racy, pithy anecdotes, and recounting them with such 
                    naivety and simplicity, that she holds the attention of her audience from first to last.</p>
                    <p>Her programme on Friday night included a very varied assortment of items. There were many short, crisp stories, and one or two
                    very humorous dialogues of greater length; and an exceedingly clever item in which she impersonated a charming young aunt endeavouring
                    to tell an edifying story to a child who refused to be edified. The "piece-de-resistance" of the programme was perhaps the item 
                    entitled "Harry," which gave Miss Critten real scope for her dramatic instinct, and which certainly accounted for a very chokey sensation
                    in the throats of more than one of her bearers. Miss Blanche Simpson provided a little music during the interval which Miss Critten
                    found neccessary to rest her voice; for the one-hour-recital did not finish for some time after 10:30, and must have been a tiring 
                    performance.</p>
                    <p>Miss Critten is giving a second recital at the Savoy to-night at 9.30, when it is anticipated that she will receive a very good hearing.
                    She is so exceptionally clever, that one can unhesitatingly recommend any one who is in search of a new sensation to attend one of her 
                    performances. Hotel visitors are so prone to complain of the dulness of their evening hours, that short entertainments such as Miss 
                    Critten's should be particularly acceptable.</p>

                    <subhead> Mr. Dicey's New Boook</subhead>
                    <p>A very interesting book on the political situation of this country has just been published by Heinemann (price 3s. 6d) entitled
                    "The Future of Egypt." The author is M. Edward Dicey, whose forty odd years' connection with Egypt renders him a peculiarly competent
                    critic. The author's object is "to direct attention to certain defects in British administration under our protectorate, and 
                    to the policy by which these defects could best be rectified." The author criticises Lord Cromer's system of government and the 
                    suppression of the capitulations. His criticisms are characterised by a boldness which is very rare among English writers in Egypt, 
                    but they are at the same time quite free from the personal vindictiveness which prevents Mr. Wilfrid Blunt from being taken seriously 
                    so far as matters Egpytian are concerned. We will deal with Mr. Dicey's work in other issue, as there are a great many passages which 
                    deserve reproduction. Meanwhile we will conclude this brief, preliminary notice of a book, which we recommend all interested in Egypt 
                    to obtain for themselves, by one excerpt, which will give our readers some idea of the style of tbe work. The following are Mr Dicey’s 
                    opinions on Lord Cromer’s scheme of reforms in connection with the suppression of the capitulations as contained in his latest report:-</p>
                    <p>'To speak plain English, the way to understand the projeot in question is to strike out the name of Egyptian Government whenever it appears, 
                     and to substitute for it that of the British Agency. The capitulations, the Mixed Tribunals, the Consuls-General accredited to the Khedive, 
                        and last but not least the European companies and capitalists, are the only influlences left in Egypt which interfere with the absolute 
                        autocracy Lord Cromer’s policy would confer, not only upon himself, but upon his successors in the post, he now occupies as the 
                        representative of our unavowed Protectorate. I find it difficult to comprehend how antonomy is compatible with absolute personal autncracy. 
                        I learn from Lord Cromer's two last reports that the aim of his policy is tp prepare Egypt for antonomy. I do not doubt for one moment 
                        the sincerity of this avowal. My intelligence, however, is unlimited to enable me to understand how the absolute autorsey of the ruler can be 
                        the way to prepare the ruled for autonomy. The process seems to me analogons to that of the schnolmeter who undertook to teach his pupils the art
                        of swimming but would never allow them to go into the water till they had learnt to swim.”</p>

                    <div><head>Army Notes</head>
                    <p>(From Our Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>London, January 27.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant the Honorable CD. Baring, Coldstream Guards, has left the army.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. J. M. O'Connor, Presbyterian chaplain, has been directed to proceed to Egypt for duty there.</p>
                    <p>Second Lieutenant Loftus. 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, has been promoted lieutenant after three years' service.</p>
                    <p>The three troopers of the Deopt Squadron 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, Ballincollig, whose Christmas midnight escapde has been already
                    reported in these notes, were tried by a district court martial last week, and found guilty. The sentence will be duly promulgated and it
                    is safe to say that the three men will not hanker after gagging and tying up sentries and commandeering horses for some time to come.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Haldane’s new organisation scheme has been not ineptly likened to the mountain in labour, and "Punch” has very happily hit off the 
                        situation by representing the author in the guise of a motherly old hen clucking triumphantly over her six chickens (divisions), 
                        whilst Mr. Brodrick in a simliar guise, but without the chickens, reminds the former of the fate of his six (army corps) chicks. The 
                        scheme is eminently a paper one. A striking force of 150,000 is promised, of which only 70,000 will be regulars, and a large proportion 
                        of which is not, nor never will be, available. The remainder has to be made up by problematical Militia, Yeomanry, and Volunteers. In 
                        the interim, the nucleus of the "striking force” will have to find the usual Indian, Egyptian, and Colonial drafts, a process which will 
                        result in the usual lemon squeezing of the battalions and batteries. As heretofore India and the Colonies will demand the very pick of the army 
                        at home, and nothing will be left for the striking force save the immature and the unfit. Whilst the defence of India depends on the rise and 
                        fall of the home labour market there can be no permanent solution to the difficulty. The only redeeming point in the scheme is the promised 
                        attempt to make a better use of the militiamen already serving in the old Constitutional Force. But it is only an idea of expediency, and until 
                        it is properly tested by the assay of experience no definite pronouncement can be made. To repeat it again, India blocks the way.</p>

                    <p>Lady Cadogan, whose death is announced in this morning's telegrams, was the daughter of the second Earl of Craven, her other sisters being 
                        the Countess of Wilton and the Countess of Coventry. She was born in 1844 and married in 1865 Earl Cadogan, by whom she had six sons and 
                        two daughters.</p>
                    <p>We are sorry to learn that much anxiety is felt about the health of Lady Suffield, who is lying seriously ill with a complication of influenza 
                        and bronchitis. Lady Suffield, who is a sister of the first Lord Revelstoke and of Lord Cromer, and aunt to Countess Granville, is a lady of 
                        advanced age, for it is now several years sinoe she and Lord Suffield who is past seventy-seven, celebrated their golden wedding day. They 
                        have long enjoyed the intimate friendship of the Royal Family, and it is close on forty years since Lord Suffield obtained his first Court 
                        appointment as Lord-in-Waiting to Qaeen Victoria. He holds the same office in the Household of his present Majesty, and in his case it is, 
                        by Royal favour, a permanent one, for he does not resign it on a change of Government. He was, as a matter of fact, taking his turn of waiting 
                        last week ; but, in spite of that fact, his name is omitted from the list of the King’s Household in several well- known books of reference.</p>
                    <p>In his younger days Lord Suffield was one of the finest riders and keenest all-round sportsmen in the kingdom. He was Master of the Royal Buckhounds 
                        in 1886, and hunted the Norfolk Foxhounds and Staghoands for many years showing capital sport. At one time he was superintendent of the Prince of 
                        Wales’s stables, and in the Royal expedition to India of 1875 (when he was chief of the staff to His Royal Highness he organised the sporting part 
                        of the tour with the greatest success. Lord and Lady Sufffield have had a large family, and their life has been clouded with seven domestic 
                        trials ; but their danghters, who include Countess Carrington, Lady Hingdon, and Lady Hastings, murel hap ly as well as Ini' ia tiy, and ’bey n ve a HO I an I h*dr aud a arm s i ( “» iu s tnutb yea ) to carry on ht* I * o n me * d h nour .</p>
