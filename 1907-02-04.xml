                            the mortgage debt at 8.9 %, Dr. Eid next turns his attention to the
                            effect and influences of a mortgage debt on the economical development
                            of the country.</p>
                        <p>The economical development of Egypt owes its birth to Mehemet Ali and
                            much of its sub- sequent growth to the Khedive Ismail who for all his
                            extravagances must be reckoned in many ways economically as a factor for
                            good in Egyptian agricultural history: the first barrage and many of the
                            major canals of today are stand­ing witness of his endeavours and
                            successes.</p>
                        <p>But when the inevitable crash came its ultimate result was to break up
                            the large holding in course of time we have already explained in dealing

                            of the sol , who like the yeomen of old-time in England may truly be
                            considered the backbone of the country. To the number of these who
                            became proprietors on the breakdown of Ismail finances must now be added
                            all who have bought land from the Credit Foucier and those other
                            institutions that obtained barren land from the Government converted it
                            into agricul- tural properties, and re-sold it at a comfortable profit.
                            So that to-day as compared with 80 years ago the number of peasant
                            proprietors is enormous. It is profitable therefore to cor aider if thia
                            large body of persons receive a benefit or the reverse from the money
                            they borrow on mortgage. </p>

                        <p/>

                        <p>To answer the second question we must first decide the average rate of
                            interest co mortgage money, end as not even the banks publish this it is
                            difficult to fix it accurately. The conventional maximum in Egypt is 9%
                            and the Agricultural bank, which charges the highest rate owing to the
                            smallness its loans and the comparative shortness of their dura- tion,
                            bee now dropped it. rate from 9% to 8<hi rend="italic">%. </hi>But on
                            ventes e teime the rate probably varies from 4% to 5%. Dr. Eid, after
                            careful consideration, fixes on the following rate, as forming the
                            average rate, to-day: 6.2% for the Bank., 5 for assurance end other
                            companies,</p>
                        <p>8 for private individuals, and 5 for rentes &amp; tormer, whereas in 1895
                            the average rate was. at least 8% all round. If then, as is the cure,

                            254% the amount paid as charges thereon has only shown an increase of
                            194%. 'Meanwhile daring those years the exports of the country, well
                            called ‘lo miroir par excellence do dere'opment doouomiqae," shows an

                            diminishing.</p>
                        <p>But possibly ell these generalisations ate not applicable to any given
                            cases. Let us there­fore take the example of a total mortgage effected
                            first by the proprietor of a email holding of 5-feddans and second of a
                            somewhat larger holding of say 50 feddans and let us see how heavily the
                            burden of high debt weighs upon the mortgager, In the first place, to
                            replace moneys by the produce of the soil takes at least 15 years and
                            that that is fully recognised is shown by the fact that the
                            Agri­cultural Bank lately advanced its maximum period from 15 to 20
                            years and that the average duration,of a loan granted by the other banks
                            is 19 years. </p>
                        <p>Now let us assume the value of our land at L.E. 100 a feddan, giving in
                            the first instance a total of L.E. 500 On this the banks will advance up
                            to 60 % of its value, say, LE 300, end putting the rate at its highest,
                            let us say at 7 % plus l. % for expenses. To repay this in 15 years, Dr.
                            Eid estimates will require an ■ amortisation fund of LE 28 to L.E 34 per
                            annum, and as the soil in Egypt gives a return of at • least 7 % our
                            tellah mortgager makes LE 35 per annum and at the same time lives off
                            his land. Thus at the end of 15 years he will stand quit of his debt
                            with a minimum of £15 set aside, and during those fifteen years it must
                            not be forgotten that he has supported himself and bit family on the
                            produce of the lend, besides making some profit on what we may call
                            bye-products such as milk, eggs, chickens, goats and the like, which are
                            mainly self-supporting and find their own sustenance at best they can.
                            In troth, LB. 15 in. 15 years - is not wealth, but for the Egyptian
                            peasant it is as far removed from destination as it is from riches
                            according to the European standpoint. Finally we mast remember that at
                            the end of the period he 'is possessed of a property improved to the
                            value of the mort­gage money sank therein and of 15 years' constant
                            labor spent thereon.</p>
                        <p> The larger the property the greater the amount that can be putby; for
                            the interest is re- funded and the term extended as that our pro­prietor
                            of 50 feddene cf similar value on a total mortgage amounting to
                            somewhere between LE 8,500 and LE 3 000 at 7 % all told would have to
                            set aside an amortisation fund of be tween L.E 235 and LE 280 per annum,
                            and would gain from his laud L.E 350, leaving the comparatively
                            comfortable margin of L.E. 70 to LE 115 per annum. And as a further
                            proof that the fellaheen are not weighed down by a burden of debt,a
                            study of the number of expro­priations renders the matter quite clear.
                            In 1897 those amounted to 266. while in 1905 bey were but 110 and of
                            these the majority represent the results of the execution of judge
                            -ments given in transactions other than mort­gage transactions.</p>
                        <p>Finally Dr. Bid draws hit conclusions from all these carefully compiled
                            and well-arranged statistics. The mortgage debt of Egypt is lower io
                            proportion than that of any other civilised country, and that not
                            withstanding the fact that from the fertility of its soil Egypt is
                            fitted to boar an unusually heavy mortgage debt without inconvenience
                            But the time, Dr. Eid thinks, has now come to pause a little and
                            consolidate what is already under cultivation, rather than seek to
                            extend the area of fertility ; and that the Government think alike with
                            Dr. Eid on this point is proved by 'be fact that the water0 the main or
                            sole source of Egypt's fertility—is now being employed in improvements
                            rather than in extensions and in perfecting whet is already began rather
                            than in attempting any new undertakings. But this period of
                            consoli­dation, we are told, though necessary, need not be of long
                            duration, and already vast projects</p>

                    <p>The most distinguished of early British diplomatists, Sir Henry Wotton, Kt.
                        (1568- 1639), whilst passing through Germany on his way to Venice and
                        staying at Augsburg, wrote in his post’s album the following definition
                        :</p>
                    <p>causa:" intended, as he tells us in his autobiography, to be English as
                        follows : “An Ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for his
                        country’s good,” a definition capable of two interpretations in English, hut
                        only one in the original. The long telegram, published on Saturday,
                        describing the interview in Germany of Mr. Stead, re­minds us of a
                        less-known aphorism of Sir Henry : “A Chancellor is a deceitful man kept at
                        home for the purpose for which an Am- basador is sent abroad.”</p>

                        works at Assouan Mr. Vernon com menced business in Alexandria, and for the
                        last two years be had been manager and director of the British Engineering

                        <p>TERRORISING CONSTANTINOPLE</p>
                        <p>Constantinople, February 8.</p>
                        <p>Baron Marschall de Beiberstein was received in audience by the Sultan.
                            The crimes of Fehim Pasha were the chief subject of the conversation,
                            and as a result his Majesty has ordered the formation of a special com-
                            mission at Yildiz to examine the chargee. Fehim Pasha has become an
                            object of terror to everybody. In the meanwhile he parades the city
                            ostentatiously. <hi rend="italic">(Reuter</hi>

                        <p>It is with a certain measure of relief that we hear of the action taken
                            by the German Em­bassy at Constantinople to punish Fehim Pasha chief of
                            the Hafirh. Thia functionary has thus far enjoyed immunity owing to the
                            fact of his being son of the foster-brother of the Sultan, and therefore
                            a privileged bosom ser- pent. A worthy successor of Ghani Bey, whose
                            oppressions are recorded in Mr. Holme Beaman’s interesting book on the
                            Near East, Fehim has been, and is still,, the object of the hatred and
                            terror of all Turkish subjects. His gor­geous carriage, with its yellow
                            upholstery, is one of the sights of Pera as it rolls swiftly down the
                            Grande Roe, with his Ex­cellency seated pompous'y in it—a fat and short
                            man with a decidedly unpleasant cast of countenance. His rival at Coart
                            is Nejib Melbame (or Malfame, to quote a Perote nick­name) and both have
                            distinguished them­selves by their seal in hatching and revealing the
                            same plots ! Fehim is more daring than the conning Syrian ; possibly
                            because he feels himself more secure. Twice, at night, he has striven to
                            get sympathy at Yildiz by the singularly risky method of dropping from
                            this same gorgeous vehicle a bomb timed to ex­plode when his person was
                            sufficiently removed from danger. This served another purpose. It was
                            intended to prove the existence of conspiracy, to* discover which Fehim
                            and Mal- fame had received a commission. Malfame was the first to be
                            commissioned. He miraculously unearthed a nest of bombs and conspirators
                            and after ransacking every nook and corner, he assured the Sultan that
                            he might repose in absolute tranquillity. This would not do for Fehim,
                            who, to upset the Saltan’s confidence in his rival, resorted to the
                            barbarous method above described. Perhaps it was a coincidence, but
                            strange to relate the outrages presumably attempted on his person took
                            place soon after the mysterious removal from Top Hana of several of the
                            bombs which Malfame had found. Q E D. It remains to be seen what
                            punishment the Saltan will mete oat to his foster son, to appease the
                            wrath of the in­dignant German Elchi—possibly some promo­tion to the
                            provinces and a subsequent restora­tion to Imperial favour.</p>

                        <p>Assouan has never had a more brilliant season than the present. For the
                            last week the three hotels of the Upper Egypt Hotels conference have
                            been full, and, judging by the nu¬merous orders coming in daily, will
                            remain so' for some time to come. There are 320 visitors staying at the
                            Cataract Hotel, 80 at the Savoy, and 120 at the Grand Hotel. The hotels
                            at Luxor belonging to the same company are doing just as well, and the
                            new Winter Palace Hotel, although only newly opened, is already
                            overbooked. Among the visitors staying at Assouan are Sir Wllliam and
                            Lady Ewart and family, Comte de Bruges and suite, Comte and Comtesse

                        <p>THE POST OFFICE FRAUDS</p>

                        <p>Yesterday, an interesting development oc­curred in the startling case of
                            the forgery of foreign money orders through the Egyptian Post Office.
                            When the Florio-Rubattino S.S. Singapore arrived at Alexandria from
                            Naples it was boarded by the Alexandria police, who at once arrested one
                            of the passengers, on the charge of having acted as accomplice on the
                            continent of Europe in farthering the machina tions of the person who
                            styled himself “George Bey,’’ in attempting to enoash money orders to
                            the extent of £20,000. The man, when seized by the police, gave his name
                            as Zinos Velis.</p>
                        <p>The history of the discovery of this fraud is very interesting, and
                            reflects great credit on the Egyptian Postal Administration for so
                            promptly following up the matter. A telegram was received last week at
                            the General Post Office at Alexandria from the post office at Milan
                            announcing the arrival of an unusual number of foreign money orders from
                            Egypt and asking whether they were to be cashed. This telegram was
                            followed by others sent from the postal authorities at Rome, Brussels,
                            and Berne couched in similar terms. The issue of the orders was stated
                            to have taken place on the 22nd ulto.</p>
                        <p>The Postmaster General thereupon entrusted Borton Bey with a mission of
                            enquiry, and that official left for Cairo on Thursday. It was discovered
                            that there had been a most serious fraud committed, for the European
                            post offices had wired the serial numbers of the money orders. Farther
                            enquiries pointed to a certain Georgiadis, a clerk in the Cairo post
                            office, as being the guilty party It was found that he was nominally on
                            sick leave at Helouan. When his whereabouts were sought after there no
                            trace of him was discovered. Telegrams were then sent to the Italian
                            General Post Office at Rome with orders to arrest such a man, as he was
                            presumably following the money orders in order to encash them. A
                            telegram was received at the General Post Office at Alexandria on Friday
                            night announcing that the Italian authorities had effected the arrest at
                            Naples of a man of the name of “George Bey.” Further telegrams arrived
                            here on Saturday from Naples stating that the man, who bad been
                            arrested, had admitted that his real name was Georgiadis, and that he
                            was a postal clerk at Cairo.</p>
                        <p>A number of the money orders bad been ad­dressed to a certain Zanos, and
                            another official enquiry was opened to discover the whereabouts of this
                            person, but this was cleared up by a telegram from Italy to the effect
                            that a man of that name had embarked , on the Fiorio-Rubattino S.S.
                            Singapore, which was due to arrive at Alexandria yesterday; The arrest
                            was effected, as we have announced, and as Zanos is a local subject be
                            was handed over to the Egyptian authorities and interro- gated by the
                            Parquet this morning. He admitted to the Parquet that he was employed by
                            Georgiades.</p>
                        <p>Georgiadis, who is a Hellenic subject, bears an excellent character in
                            his official capacity,</p>
                        <p>and was recognised as a quiet, respectable, hard-working postal
                            employe.</p>
                        <p>The total amount involved was £20,000 and it is satisfactory to know that
                            nothing has been paid over. The fraud was executed on the 23rd ulro. and
                            by yesterday, the 3rd inst., both the men implicated were in gaol in
                            various parts of the world. The Egyptian postal authorities are to be
                            congratulated on the celerity with which they followed up the
                            indications they received from Europe.</p>

                        <p>SAVOY HOTEL.</p>
                        <p>SATURDAY’S FESTIVITIES.</p>
                        <p>Few outside invitations had been issued for Saturday’s dance at the
                            Savoy; but the house is so crowded, and there were such a number of
                            dinner parties arranged for that night, that the ball-room and lounge
                            were patronized to their full later on in the evening. Every avail¬able
                            table was occupied in the dining-room and restaurants, the overflow
                            being accom¬modated in the covered-in verandah. Sir Ernest Cassel was
                            one of the hosts of the evening, having Lady Newborough and Mrs. Cassel
                            among his party. Mrs. Leverioh had a large party, and among the other
                            hosts were Dr. Tribe, Mr. and Mrs. Cochrane, Mr. Phillipson, Mrs. and
                            Miss Bennett, Count and Countess Hellnstein, Biron Pfyffer, Baron
                            Bleich-iTfor, Baron Biederman, M. and Mme Cordonier, Mr. and Miss
                            Pooley, Mr. Wigham, etc. The sexett orchestra discoursed very gentle
                            music during the dinner hour, and the Ladies’ Orchestra did their duty
                            bravely during the remainder of the evening. The latter has improved
                            wonderfully daring the last few weeks, and if most people will insist
                            upon waltzes which grow faster and faster, there are many dancers now
                            who are learning the charm of a slow dance to a quick measure.</p>
                        <p>Never this season have so many beautiful frocks been seen at the Savoy;
                            and one wonders whether the ladies of Cairo have pondered to some
                            purpose over the saying of one of our habitnes, that every one should on
                            her arrival look away at least two of her best dresses and forget all
                            about them till the 1st of February Certainly every frock almost on
                            Saturday looked fresh enough to give colour to the sunrise and many of
                            them were of quite the best frock or¬der. No one looked better than the
                            Countess of Hellnstein in a wonderful dress of yellow draped with fine
                            lace about the shoulders,whioh lace hung in long ends from the back of
                            the elevated waist line. Her high coiffure was crowned with an enormous
                            bunch of paradis in pale yellow and white, a form of decoration to which
                            she is much addicted. Lady Newboroogh was wearing a lovely frock of pink
                            satin edged with a flowing line of diamentee lace and velvet. The draped
                            corsage was a mass of glittering jewels and sequins, and she wore a
                            bunch of pink osprey in her hair. Mrs. Charlton also wore a lovely dress
                            of lace made over and trimmed with pale grey satin, and Miss McKellar’s
                            dress of yellow chiffon, bearing many frills and insertions and
                            trimmings of guipure d’lrelande, was most dainty and attrac¬tive Mrs.
                            Carey, with her beautiful white hair, looked her best in a dress of
                            black lace over white with bretelles and trimming of turquoise velvet
                            her ermine scarf adding the finishing touch to a charming toilette. Mme
                            Sursock was in cream satin much embroidered with passe¬menterie and
                            bearing a deep hem of pink velvet embroidered with gold. Her pretty
                            daughter was in yellow with a gold fillet in her hair. Mrs Wain was with
                            her two daughters,the eldest looking very well in a plain princess frock
                            of yellow satin, and Miss Blythe locked extremely handsome in a
                            beautiful frock of pale green. Miss Shaw had on a dainty frock of
                            spotted net over pale pink, many garlands of pink ribbon ruching
                            trimming both skirt and bodice, and Miss Molloy was in a dress of grey
                            chiffon taff tas. he soft corsage being of much betnek- ed chiffon of
                            the same shade. Mrs. Rome had on an embroidered black lace dress over
                            pale blue, and Mrs. Wilding’s dress of black had many stripes of dark
                            blue iridescent embroidery upon it. Mrs. Wynne was in a soft gown of
                            cream with incrustations of silver embroidery, and Miss Leverich was
                            also in cream, her satin frock being trimmed with insertions of
                            diamentee lace. Mrs. Armstrong, who is chape¬roning the two Miss de
                            Vahls this season, was in a handsome gown of grey velvet, while the Miss
                            de Vahls wore pretty pompadeur and pink chene silk respectively. Mrs.
                            Stout’s dress of thick lace edged and trimmed with blue velvet was much
                            admired. Mrs. Nungovicb, who arrived late, was wearing a magnificent
                            toilette of golden tissue oyer which was a robe of embroidered chiffon,
                            and Miss Nungovioh was in the daintiest of lace frocks softly gleam- ing
                            with mother-of-pearl pailettes and embroid¬ered with pink roses. Miss
                            Hurley was in pale blue with a glittering bolero and bows of black; and
                            one Miss York was also in pale blue, while the second was wearing a most
                            becoming frock, of emerald green chiffon outlined with narrow bands of
                            green sequins, and with golden tassels hanging from the sleeves and also
                            from the fillet in her hair.</p>

                        <p>A SUCCESSFUL DANCE.</p>
                        <p>Ghszireh Palace Hotel has more than its usual complement of smart
                            visitors this year, and the dance on Thursday evening attracted many of
                            the residents in the neighbourhood as well as a goodly assortment from
                            Cairo. Many came as dinner guests, Mr. Yorke having a party of eight and
                            Mr. Gosohen one of ten. Mr. Curphey, Sir Hugh and Lady Smiley, Mrs
                            Morcom, Mr. and Mrs. Ritz, Baron and Baronne de Pfyffer, and Mrs. Carey
                            also had guests, and Mrs. and Miss Crofton were cele- brating their
                            arrival in company with Mr. and Mrs. Hadow. At another table were being
                            enter- tained Mme. Reyntian and her son, Me. and Mme. Bazil, Miss Ami,
                            Mrs. Maclean, Mme. Agaion. Mile, de Codt, Mr. Priolean, Mr. Fox, and Mr.
                            Irwin, while Mrs. Howell’s party included Mrs. Stanley Bird, Miss Mo-
                            Kellar, Lord Royston, the Hon. Claude Yorke, and Mr. G. W. Bennett.</p>
                        <p>The beautiful lounge was a brilliant sight daring the interval between
                            dinner and the dance : the many uniforms of the soldiers pre sent adding
                            their quota to the general effect. There were almost too many people
                            present for the ball-room ; but no one minds sitting out at Ghezireh,
                            where there are so many cosy corners and such delightful surroundings.
                            Mr. Machell and Lady Valda Machell were noticed in the hall; and the
                            Hon. Mr. and Mrs. Findlay were also present. Sir Thomas Wrightson was
                            also seen chatting with his friends; and Mrs. and Miss Crofton were
                            being eagerly greeted by their friends : for they are both very
                            popu¬lar, and Miss Crofton has the reputation for being a beautiful
                            dancer. Mrs. Carey was chaperoning her daughter and Miss F x ; and</p>
                        <p>rs. Leverich was also there with Miss Leverioh wearing a pretty black
                            frock. Everyone was glad to see Mrs. Donegan back among the dancers; and
                            Mrs Rom made her re appearance after her illness, which luckily was not
                            of long duration. The Misses York were very much admired in their pretty
                            frocks and with ribbons twisted in their fair hair; and Miss Rees could
                            have filled her card many times over, as usual. Lord and Lady Vivian
                            ware present with Miss Vivian wearing a delightful Empire frock of grey
                            net, and the Countess von Hollen- stein was a most striking figure in
                            black panne with a mass of waving white feathers in her coifare. The
                            Misses Coles were in blue, as was Miss Feara her cousin, Miss Joseph
                            wear¬ing white net. Mrs. Howell wore a very hand¬some dress of satin
                            bearing heavy applications of gold embroidery, and Miss McKellar had on
                            a lovely frock of net and lace over palest pink em- broidered with tiny
                            roses and relieved by lines of thin black. Mrs. Wyane was in one of her
                            dainty frocks, a lovely shade of blue, with sleeves and chemisette of
                            white, and blue bretelles across the shoulders, and Miss Blythe looked
                            her stately best in vieux rose. Mrs. Chatterton Adams’ dress of run with
                            tiny frills of black, and Mrs. Peach was wearing a black lacs dress
                            mounted over white. Mrs. Hunter also wore a magpie dress of black and
                            white lace, and Mrs. Trafford Huteson was well turned ont as ever in a
                            diamentee dress of yellow. Miss Coxon looked well in black, a colour
                            which various others had also patron¬ized.</p>
                        <p>Among others noticed during the even¬ing were Mrs. Twomey, Mme Reyntians,
                            Capt. and Mrs. Bayley, Mrs. Maclean, Mrs. Park Lyle, Dr. and Mrs.
                            Phillips, the Messrs, and Miss de Bilinski, Mrs Stanley Bird. Mr. and

                        <p>An extra item of interest was added to this evening by the presence of
                            Miss Julie Critten, the clever palmist, who received her clients in one
                            of the drawing rooms of the hotel. Many people have already taken
                            advantage of this clever lady’s services, and she is already being
                            eagerly sought after. Miss Critten is making arrangements to receive her
                            clinetele from time to time at the Savoy; and ere long it is expected
                            that she will be in as great request in Cairo as she already is in Bond

                        <p>OPERA HOUSE STRIKE. </p>
                        <p>* The strike of the fourteen musicians at the Khedivial Opera House,
                            Cairo, is the talk of the Capital. According to their version, they had
                            counted on extra earnings to make ends meet, such, for instance, as a
                            series of classic concerts at the Cercle Artistique. M. Poncet objected;
                            whence the defection. The Cairote Press deals with the question from
                            points of view characteristic of their respective opinion. “L’Egypte” is
                            opposed to all arbitrary measures adopted against the strikers, and
                            wonders that such incidents have not taken place before, in view of the
                            antecedents of the direotor of the troupe.</p>
                        <p>“L’Orient” counsels moderation, and an appeal to the good offices of M.
                            le Consul de France. It apmpathises with M. Poncet, and absolves him of
                            all blame.</p>
                        <p>The “Journal da Caire” writes in the same strain.</p>
                        <p>The “Pyramides” is funny: “It is true that concord is not the most
                            shining point of our musicians of the Opera. The Press has said so since
                            the beginning of the season.”</p>

                            on its obvious pivots, even as the “Umberto Primo” rolls off the Cretan

                            porters and boatmen in Naples harbour all was a joy, tinged with hope of
                            “leave” to come or reminiscence of leave enjoyed. Even the cabin
                            hangings which M. Fontaine brushed aside as he came and went were a
                            memory of bathrooms and cabins, poignant and vivid. Yet no “Rubattino”
                            or other boat could find its wild way to that weird island peopled with
                            high- priests of the Brahmin persuasion, ballet- dancers, and, last of
                            all, savages in sumptuous armour and European boots : those of course
                            they had footed from the late departed crew of the ill-fated ship. Oh !
                            most exquisite island, most romantic ship!</p>
                        <p>The opera itself was performed much as usual, not without vigour and
                            inaccuracy. Mile. Devillay, though, was really delicious. M. Fontaine
                            seems to take to the fort tenor” parts, and enjoys his high notes. He is
                            really a fine actor and musician. What a pity his voice is so
                            displeasing ! He deserves a better fate. The orchestra, it appears, was
                            “on strike,” bat it was hard to notice any great difference, except that
                            there were fewer and less prominent discords. M. Archimbaud would
                            probably do quite well with two men and a boy, instead of the
                            recalcitrant band he fails to control.</p>

                        <p>ABBAS THEATRE.</p>
                        <p>There were two really had episodes in “Mefitofele” : the chorus in the
                            prologue was appalling, and in the second part Signora Orbellini gave an
                            entirely wrong rendering of the ‘Elena” music. The “La luna piena’
                            should be, vocally, as cold, as dear, as rippling as the words are
                            themselves. She treated it as she would have treated “La Tosca.”
                            However, her voice in itself is charming, the mistake was technical
                            only. The only other fault was a certain want of cohesion in the garden
                            scene; but Signor Lucenti saved the situation.</p>
                        <p> With these exceptions, it was really finely given. The conductor knows
                            the opera, he handles his orchestra with a splendid keen vigour and
                            intellectually, which one appre­ciates after Signor Archimbaud’s
                            listless,almost careless, treatment. Signor Battani, for all he has a
                            bad cold, was exquisite; one could only just detect a certain slight
                            huskiness ; and be seemed disinclined to take any notes higher th>n a
                            natural He took them all the same once or twice. Signa. Fabris was
                            nervous until the 3rd act. In that she was faultless; she sang with all
                            the sweetness, passion, and dramatic power the scene requires. And
                            Signor Lucenti ! He was not Signor Lucenti, he was Mifitofele incarnate.
                            He conveyed every least shade of irony, sarcasm, scathing contempt that
                            Bolto has put into the part; and his voice is a thing to dream of.—a
                            superb full bass, resonant, never harsh, never a hair-breadth off the
                            note. The part could not have been better sung. We have heard Signor
                            Walter in the pain 1904-1905 and he evidently gave it finely this season
                            at Alexandria. But Signor Lucenti puts his rendering, fine as it is,
                            entirely into the shade. The prologue—where we forgot all the evil
                            discords of the chorus, the “Fischio fischio” song in all its utter
                            contempt for. God and man, the whole of the Brocken scene, the mocking,
                            disgusted,disdainfal satire of “Questa Attica Terra,” and the finale
                            where the fiend descends, vanquished, but still great and contemptuous
                            -one can find no words for these. I think if the Alexandria critic had
                            heard it, he would hava changed bis opinion of Bolto and bis opera.
                            Many, it is true, —many eminent musicians as well—think little enough of
                            Bolto : they say he cannot orchestra, his effects shadowy, his scenes
                            badly arranged, hie methods old-fashioned and poor. Bat the fact remains
                            that "Mefistofele,” for all it failed in 1868. is now given all over-
                            Italy, as well as in London and Faris, and that ‘Mefistofele” had as
                            much influences as the work of Verdi himself on Italian opera. And
                            really the beauty of the 3rd act, of the “Fisohio” song, of the Greek
                            underworld scene, and the weird declamation on the Brocken, do deserve
                            acknowledgment. Of course, Bolto under-orchestrates; he only wrote that
                            one opera. How should he learn in one opera t&lt; handle orchestras. He
                            is an experimentalistwith no sort of wish to turn out 30 or 40 big
                            pieces of work ; he is an analyst and a poet the whole of the libretto
                            is taken from the original legend. He owes nothing to Gounod, and only a
                            certain amount to Goethe himself his reading is totally different. All
                            through the music, too, he experiments : he has special instruments and
                            orchestration for Mefistofele- the "equilli” and certain pizzicato
                            effects- and for Faust, usually violins and a certain soft and more
                            melodious suavity. Of course, the whole work must be carefully given and
                            properly staged. The Brocken scene, the Greek scene, the “Si gira, si
                            gira” chorus, all have their absurd side; but so have many great operas.
                            Anyone who heard M. Zuccani do the “Tannhauser” overture in waltz time
                            will acknowledge that. Signor Lucenti, by t<hi rend="underline">he</hi>
