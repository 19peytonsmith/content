                    <head>PRINCE HOHENLOHE'S DIARY</head>
                    <p>Commenting on the publication of the Memoirs of Prince Hohenlohe, the
                        "Morning Post" says:-</p>
                    <p>A twofold interest attaches to the publication in Germany of extracts from
                        the Memoirs of Prince Hohenlohe giving an account of the points of
                        disagreement between the German Emperor and Prince Bismarck which led to the
                        Prince's resignation of the Chancellorship of the Empire.</p>
                    <p>The resignation of the First Chancellor was an event of historical
                        importance, and everything that throws light upon it and enables the truth
                        to be known is valuable to the student of history and of politics. The fact
                        of the publication of these extracts from Prince Hohenlohe's Memoirs has,
                        however, to be regarded also from another point of view. The story told
                        throws light upon the character and policy of the present German Emperor.
                        The publication, therefore, would hardly have been risked in a country where
                        free discussion of the Emperor's character and policy is not permitted,
                        unless it was likely to be acceptable in high quarters. It may, therefore,
                        be taken to be thought opportune that these disclosures should now be made;
                        in other words, it is thought that they will have the effect in Germany of
                        strengthening public confidence in the Emperor. The story told is
                        exceedingly probable. It agrees with what was relieved at the time by the
                        best informed diplomatists in Europe. Moreover, it rests upon the best
                        possible authorities, for Prince Hohenlohe records his conversations with
                        the Empress Frederick and the Grand Duke of Baden, as well as with the
                        Emperor and Prince Bisraark. The disagreements turned on two points of
                        policy. One was domestic. The Emperor was anxious for further action by way
                        of relieving the lot of the working class.</p>
                    <p>He thought that if nothing were done the Socialists would have a lever by
                        which they might raise up a movement that would need to be put down by
                        force, and he was determined at the beginning of his reign not to be forced
                        to let his soldiers Are upon the people. But Bismarck was opposed to further
                        legislation in the direction of State Socialism. The other difference was on
                        foreign policy. The Emperor thought it right to support his Austro-Hungarian
                        ally in resistance to contemplated Russian encroachments in South- Eastern
                        Europe. If the Russian Government had moved an Army towards Bulgaria the
                        Austro-Hungarian Government would have been bound in its own interests to
                        that movement. The German Emperor thought that in such a case he must come
                        to the assistance of Austria-Hungary. But Bismarck proposed that if the case
                        were to arise Germany should remain neutral. He was afraid that supporting
                        Austria would involve Germany in the war which he dreaded against Russia and
                        France at once. These were serious differences, for they touched, the one a
                        vital matter of domestic policy, and the other the cardinal point of foreign
                        policy. But there was a further disagreement of a formal nature. When
                        Bismarck became Minister-President of Prussia under King William I. there
                        was in existence a Cabinet Order, that is, a Royal rescript, dated 1852-in
                        the reign of King Frederick William IV.-by which the Ministers other than
                        the Minister-President were debarred from direct access to the King.
                        Bismarck, as Minister-President, for many years acted in the spirit of this
                        decree. He made himself responsible to the King for Prussian policy, and he
                        enjoyed the King's confidence. Accordingly at one time he paid little
                        attention to the letter of the decree. But, on the accession of William II.
                        as Emperor and King, Bismarck worked the decree of 1852 for all it was worth
                        in order to keep in his own hands the control of affairs. The Emperor wished
                        to be able to consult other Ministers as well as Bismarck, and desired the
                        old rule to 1)6 abrogated. When it became clear to him that there was a real
                        and profound disagreement between himself and his Chancellor he sent to ask
                        Bismarck for either his acquiescence in the abrogation of the rule or his
                        resignation. Bismarck replied by sending his resignation. The Emperor felt
                        that the point had come when it was a question whether he should be Emperor
                        in fact as well as in name, or merely an Emperor reigning but not governing,
                        taking his directions from a Mayor of the Palace. This part of the story has
                        been told before. The exact nature of the disagreement on Germany's foreign
                        policy has hardly been as clearly put, so far as we remember, as it is in
                        Prince Hohenlohe's Memoirs. Very characteristic are some of the details of
                        the picture. Bismarck's violent temper was well known. He has himself told
                        how after a political argument he would relieve his feelings by breaking
                        something. After one of the last angry outbursts the Emperor told the Grand
                        Duke of Baden that Bismarck had just managed not to throw the inkpot at his
                        head, and the Grand Duke himself a few days later found Bismarck so rude
                        that he had to bring the audience to an abrupt close. In all probability the
                        Emperor was substantially in the right on the points in dispute. It was
                        wiser to take some steps towards meeting the working-men's troubles than to
                        do nothing and await a conflict. It was probably wiser and was certainly
                        more loyal to support Austria-Hungary against Russia than to remain neutral
                        and encourage Russia. It was certainly better for Germany that there should
                        be a Monarchy than that there should be a Bismarck dynasty. The interesting
                        question is why the present moment should be chosen for the publication of
                        these details. The purpose maybe to stem the growth of the Bismarck legend,
                        which has been remarkable during the last few years, and to remind the
                        German public that, great as Bismarck was, he was nothing without the
                        support of King William I., and in his quarrel with the present Emperor was
                        in form and substance in the wrong. A different explanation has been
                        suggested, very shrewdly, in Austria. There the theory is that the
                        publication has for its purpose to show, what is the fact, that in a crisis
                        when the fate of the Dual Monarchy was at stake the Emperor William was that
                        Monarchy's firm friend and steadfast ally. In either case, we venture to
                        think, only good can come of the truth becoming known. There is a good deal
                        yet to be known about Bismarck, not by any means all to his credit. He
                        himself, by the heartless cruelty with which he persecuted those who
                        happened to disagree with him, made upon those who were behind the scenes an
                        indelible impression of brutality. He was a bully, and his policy was that
                        of a bully. The revelations now- made, which will in part be new to the bulk
                        of the German public, will help German opinion to see in truer perspective

                    <head>BIG ARRIVAL OF METAL TODAY</head>
                    <p>OPINION IN LONDON- This morning £1,280,000 sterling arrived at Alexandria by
                        the Austrian Lloyd's S.S. Habshurg, and another large shipment of gold is
                        expected next week. London, October 8. The American demand for gold having
                        sunk into the background, the London Money Market only finds itself face to
                        face with a strong enquiry for sovereigns on Egyptian account. A demand of
                        this kind had to be dealt with for a good many years, and in earlier times
                        the outflow of sovereigns in the late autumn and winter was usually followed
                        by the reflux of a considerable proportion of the amount in the spring. The
                        coins, which are legal tender in Egypt, are needed to assist the bank in
                        financing the cotton crop, which has become so important a factor in
                        Egyptian production, and this explains the movement to and fro. Latterly,
                        however, the prosperity of the country has been great, that only a small
                        proportion of the sovereigns dispatched. There have returned, the remainder
                        being either retained by the banks kept in circulation, and therefore the
                        exports recent years from this side have taken more and more the character
                        of a positive loss to our fa supplies. In one sense this retention of the
                        coins was expected to diminish the demand each year, as the stock held in
                        the country steadily grew larger. These expectations, however, have been
                        upset by the storm in the Southern States of the United States, which has
                        led to a remarkable advance in the price of cotton, and has produced a
                        strong demand for gold by the Egyptian banks. Since the Bank return was made
                        up £1,600,000 has been taken out, and the manner in which these withdrawals
                        have suddenly assumed importance certainly renders the maintenance of the
                        Bank rate at 4 per cent, distinctly uncertain. </p>

                    <head>NATIVES AND EUROPEAN LADIES</head>
                    <p>We have already had occasion to refer to the insulting language and conduct
                        of certain low elements in the native population towards European and Syrian
                        ladies-. Our Cairo Correspondent, confirming the case which we reported on
                        Saturday, writes : - Another instance of a serious character occurred on
                        Thursday evening, when the cries of a European child of seven years of age,
                        who was struggling to free herself from the grasp of a native, brought a
                        French passer-by to the rescue. An Englishman came in, and after some
                        difficulty the native was overpowered and taken to the caracol. A number of
                        hi3 friends assembled, and q rite oblivious of the cause of his capture,
                        threatened to murder his captors. </p>
                    <p> We hope the leaders of native opinion will exert themselves to prevent any
                        recurrence of similar incidents. We are aware that certain email class of
                        Moslem affects to consider that the fact that a woman is unveiled excuses
                        insulting language and behaviour, but Europeans have been too long settled
                        in the country for this "excuse"-if such detestable and unmanly conduct can
                        possibly be excused-to be accepted. In towns like Cape Town where a small
                        Moslem colony is settled in the midst of a large Ditch and British
                        population and in Trinidad or Demarara, where there are settlements of
                        Indian Moslems, Moslem women are safe from insult or annoyance. </p>

                    <head>THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-</head>
                    <head>PROPOSALS OF THE FOUNDERS.</head>
                    <p>We have received from Kassim Bey Amin, secretary to the committee formed for
                        the establishment of a National University, a circular, of which the
                        following is a translation:-</p>
                    <p> In latter years a general movement towards education has been observed in
                        Egypt. Among all classes this tendency exists and goes on increasing. In
                        spite of the sacrifices which the State has made, the education no long
                        supplies the needs of the country. The progressive increase of the budget of
                        the Ministry of Public Instruction has not been able to satisfy the needs of
                        the population. The Government has found itself forced to stimulate private
                        initiative so that they might gain assistance. Our nation, which is not
                        accustomed to establish such institutions, has, nevertheless, answered to
                        its appeal by subscribing largely for the creation of primary
                        schools-kuttabs. Every day we register the birth of one of these schools
                        some part of Egypt. In a few years' time one will see them in their full
                        expansion, and our little ohildren will gather the full benefit. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately the Government and the nation who have done all in their power
                        to extend primary education have op to the present been able to do nothing
                        to develope higher education. Time and money have been lacking to inaugurate
                        the formation of school for higher studies. To-day Egyptians are beginning
                        to feel that there is their education a very large gap whioh must be fulled.
                        For the last ten years the creation of a university has incessantly
                        preoccupied them. Many efforts, even, were made by several benevolent men,
                        but it seemed that the idea was not sufficiently ripe to be realisable.</p>
                    <p>This year a favorable movement has spontaneously swayed public opinion. Our
                        people have at last come to the conclusion that its system of education is
                        incomplete ; that its limits are too narrow; that it ends too soon; that
                        beyond the circle where it is confined there are sublime experiences, lofty
                        troths, transcendental speculations, interesting problems, seductive
                        hypotheses, new discoveries, captivating essays that occupy and preoccupy
                        the souls of the intellectual elect of the world, and of which only a faint
                        echo reaches it. There are new theories on the universe, society, human
                        language, morals, philosophy, history, legislation, education. All that
                        refers to the present, past, and future of humanity forms the object of many
                        sciences. Which of us knows anything about it ? Who is interested in these
                        sciences, and in these sources of wisdom ?</p>
                    <p>But what is truly astonishing is this. There is not in the whole of Egypt a
                        class where are taught the literary, scientific, and philosophical works of
                        the best known and most appreciated in Europe of the ancient Arab authors !
                        All Egyptians who are truly conscious of the inferiority of oar intellectual
                        state, and who suffer thereat, have felt that another step must be made in
                        the education of Egyptian youth.</p>
                    <p>In order that Egypt may be admitted to the ranks of civilized countries, it
                        does not suffice that the majority of its population know how to read and
                        write, nor, farther, that a class be firmed for professional knowledge, such
                        as doctor', lawyers, engineers, etc. More is needed. Those who have a
                        calling to raise themselves to the ranks of the savants, the writers that
                        Europe produces, should be allowed to ' elevate themselves to equal in
                        knowledge and intelligence the great artisans of Progress who in shadow and
                        silence work night and day for the conquest of truth and its triumph in the
                        world. It is this work that-we desire to undertake with the help of all the
                        inhabitants of Egypt.</p>
                    <p> We know that isolated State action is powerless to do all, that its goodwill
                        and power must be seconded by private initiative. We hope that our voice
                        will be heard by all those who live Egypt, no matter what their origin
                        correlation. </p>
                    <p>This foundation having awakened in minds different ideas, we deem it well to
                        define in a general way the objective of our work : -</p>
                    <p>I. The University that we desire to create is to be absolutely scientific and
                        literary. Its doors will be wide open for all desirous of learning,
                        irrespective of origin and religion.</p>
                    <p>II. It will have no connection at all with politics, or even with men who
                        occupy themselves with politics. Neither in its administration nor in the
                        classes to be organised will it tolerate the least interference, or
                        influence, that may have a greater or less degree of public character.</p>
                    <p>III. The foundation of a university uniting in itself all the orders to
                        education-primary, secondary, and higher-will be for ns an ideal that we
                        will strive to attain in a fa tare that is more or less near, and as such
                        forms part of our programme. But it is evident that the complete and
                        immediate realisation of a work enormous, will require considerable
                        resources, a staff and organisation that are difficult to realise at
                        present. We are, therefore, obliged to carry out for the present only part
                        of our programme, beginning with that which has appeared to us most urgent
                        and most profitable. Moreover, the primary and secondary education, and that
                        which we have called professional, exists already in the State and private
                        schools, and nearly satisfies our needs. Moreover, it has seemed to ns that
                        for the present we may without inconvenience not occupy ourselves therewith,
                        reserving all our efforts to inaugurate higher education which is lacking in
                        our country. Wo will create professorships to teach what is not taught in
                        Egypt : Chairs of Arabic and European literature, sciences, philosophy, and
                        history. These will be filled by professors carefully chosen in Europe, and
                        Egypt when they are available, under the direction pf a technical committee
                        presided over by a both competent and experienced man. Naturally the number
                        and "importance of these classes will depend upon the resources of the
                        University. </p>
                    <p> IV. The classes will be public, so that all desirous of learning may attend
                        them. Bat in addition to this attendance of persons of all ages and all
                        professions who attend a class to pass their time in an agreeable and
                        profitable manner, the University will admit enrolled students who will
                        follow all the classes daring a certain number of years. These students will
                        undergo ad\examination at the close of their studies, and receive a diploma
                        similar to that awarded by the school of political and moral science at
                        Paris. It is understood that the diploma will only have a moral authority,
                        but it is to be hoped that in course of time our Government will take it
                        into consideration and attach special privileges to it. </p>
                    <p>V. The meeting of the present subscribers will elect two committees, one of
                        which will be appointed to collect subscriptions, and the other with the
                        technical preparation of the education. Such is th8 programme of those who
                        were the first subscribers for the foundation of the University. Some will
                        find it ambitious and difficult to realise in Egypt: we will reply to them
                        that we will spare nothing to succeed. If despite our good intentions this
                        work fails to be effected, we hope that others, more able, will know how to
                        do better. Others, and they are in the majority, find the work modest, and
                        not so brilliant and so extended as they would desire. To these we will say
                        that success can only be obtained by knowing the measure of one's strength.
                        We would willingly reply to them : Help us for the present to lay this
                        modest foundation ; success will encourage us to do more. The day when we
                        find that our means will permit of our extending the education in the
                        University and widening its field of action, you will find us always beside
                        you, to go forward with you hand in hand. </p>

                    <head>THE "PATRIOT'S" RETURN-</head>
                    <head> MODESTY FORBIDS EXUBERANCE. </head>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel arrived at Alexandria from Europe this morning by the
                        Austrian Lloyd S.S. Habsburg.</p>
                    <p> The Egyptian "Patriot" had modestly but firmly declined when in Europe all
                        the overtures his Nationalist followers had made him to greet his arrival
                        with a demonstration on the quay. He also refused the offer of a special
                        train to Cairo, and declared that he did not wish the train in which he
                        travelled to be greeted with acclamations on its passage down the main line
                        to the Capital, and that the inhabitants of the towns and villages were not
                        to tarn out en masse to salute him. </p>
                    <p> The reason for this modesty is because he is only at the beginning of the
                        mighty work to which he intends to devote all his life, energy, and talents,
                        and therefore, although he has been most successful in his political mission
                        to Europe, any manifestation would be premature. But when the goal is
                        reached he will be quite willing to accept the public homage of the Egyptian
                        people. The result was that when Kamel set foot on Egyptian soil only his
                        brother Aly Fehmy and a few others greeted him and he was taken to the
                        station in quite an ordinary conveyance and passed unrecognized through the
                        streets.' </p>

                <div type="article">
                    <head>KAMEL'S COMPARISONS.</head>
                    <p> In a recent interview with the Correspondent of the "Pall Mall Gazette"
                        Mustapha Pasha Kamel had an interesting story to tell concerning the light
                        punishment accorded to two Greek malefactors who had assaulted a couple of
                        British officers. </p>
                    <p>The facts of the case are as follows :- Two drunken Greeks engaged in a
                        scuffle with two unknown Europeans, who wore no uniform, whose nationality
                        was not even recognised, who slipped away on the arrival of the police and
                        who never appeared to prosecute their assailants. The real assault for which
                        these Greeks were punished was committed on the persons of two policemen,
                        whom they beat and kicked. </p>
                    <p>To crown all, when brought to the caracol, they attempted to set the building
                        on fire. Tiny were sentenced to 21 days' imprisonment followed by instant
                        expulsion from the country. A sufficiently severe sentence. As the
                        "Nationalist" leader attempts to make capital oat of this incident, by
                        instituting comparisons between his version thereof and the Deuishwai
                        affair, we should like to remind our confrère of a proverb, English in its
                        origin, bat none the less applicable in Egypt. It runs thus : "Old wounds
                        are skinned by lying." </p>

                    <head>SATURDAY'S SPECIAL REGATTA</head>
                    <p>- VISIT OF THE KHEDIVE- The annual visit of his Highness the Khedive to the
                        Yacht Club on Saturday was attended, as usual, with immense success. The
                        morning opened with a strong wind from the S.E., which threatened to mar the
                        proceedings, but towards coon the wind gradually died down and veered round
                        to the W.N.W., where it remained for a little while and then died away
                        altogether. At 2 o'clock the club, the Commodore's yacht Cuhona and the
                        schooner Gilda dressed ship" and soon after the club began to fill op with
                        all its members, including most of the elite of Alexandria. </p>
                    <p>Down on the foreshore accommodation was provided for the patrons of the
                        rowing dubs who were interested in the race between their respective dubs.
                        His Highness arrived punctually at half-past four and was received at the
                        club steps by Prince Aziz Pasha Hassan and the committee of the club. x The
                        sailing handicap in Class I was won by the Ananke, which was guided to
                        victory by Mr. J. C. Wilcock, the Sans Pareille being a good second, only 36
                        seconds ^behind. The wind was so dead before Class II. was sailed that the
                        race became simply a "drifting 1 match." It seemed at first as if none of
                        the 1 boats would finish in time to claim the price, but eventually the
                        Iskindiryah, sailed by Mr. H. Fender], drifted over the finishing line with
                        10 minutes to spare, thereby winning the Khedive's challenge cup. The rest
                        of the boats kept crawling in far away into the night, and some of them had
                        to be towed home, the wind having completely died away at sunset. </p>
                    <p> Soon after his Highness arrived a race be- ion ten native boats of the old
                        type was started, all their sails being set before the' start and their
                        stern tied np to the club jetty. When the gun was fired they all cast off,
                        and everything being allowed fair in this race there was a good deal of
                        excitement, which would have been greater if the wind had been stronger. The
                        next race, which aoudad the greatest excitement, was that of the rowing
                        clubs in their outriggers. They were started at a point half-way between the
                        break water elbow and the lighthouse, at a distance of 2,500 metres from the
                        club. From the fire of the pistol the Club International Canottieri started
                        away with an even stroke and a steady boat and took the lead which they
                        maintained to the end, beating the Club Nautique Francois by about 5
                        lengths; this club also made a very good show, especially as their boat was
                        heavier and 20 centimetres broader than that of the winners. Moreover their
                        bow oar had met with an accident three days before the race and had been
                        replaced by a spare oar who had not had much time to, practise. The Deutsche
                        Sovereign, also in as a heavy a boat as that of the French Club, crossed the
                        line third, being about 4 lengths. behind the Frenchmen. The Alexandria
                        Rowing Club then followed, their boat seeming to suffer from unsteadiness
                        from the start, although of approximately the same beam as the Canottieri.
                        The winner's time was 9 min. 14 secs. </p>
                    <p> As soon as the boats hove in sight, the members of the rowing clubs watching
                        from the jetty could restrain themselves no longer and burst into cheering,
                        shouting and waving their oars, especially those of the winning club. This
                        is the third year that the Canottieri have won the race. Soon after this
                        race the oared gigs hove in sight, there being four boats entered. That of
                        the Coastguard training ship, Dib el-Bahr, was the winner, and that of the
                        Ports and Lights second-an exceedingly creditable performance considering
                        that they had had no chance of practising, only getting the boat in which
                        they polled in at noon on the day of the race. The Coastguard harbour
                        department and H.M.S. Venus followed. At the close of the races his Highness
                        presented the oops to the winners, congratulating them on their success. He
                        expressed his pleasure at all he had seen and wished the club every success
                        in the future, promising his patronage as of old. The Egyptian Army band
                        played selections of music during the afternoon. The committee wish to
                        acknowledge the kindness of the Alexandria Municipality, and of the City
                        Polio and Coastguard Administration, who assisted in keeping order on shore
                        and afloat. </p>
