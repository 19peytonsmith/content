                    <p>TRIPOLI, FRANCE. AND THE SULTAN</p>
                    <p>Tripoli is so near Egypt that any attempts ot the Sultan to increase his
                        power there is of considerable interest to us. With regard to the question
                        of the oasis of Djanet, whether the Turkish Government has despatched
                        Captain Abdul Kader with forty men, the Porte declares that the territory is
                        Turkish, being a portion of the vilayet of Tripoli, and that a holy flag is
                        preserved at Djanet, whose inhabitants pay taxes to the Turkish authorities.
                        The Frenoh Embassy at Constantinople presented a Note last week declaring
                        that Djanet was recognised as French territory by the Anglo Frenoh
                        agreement, and warning the Porte of the dangerous consequences of main
                        taining troops there. To this Note, according to Renter's telegram of
                        Saturday, the Porte has replied maintaining her olaim to Djanet as an
                        integral portion of the vilayet of Tripoli Djanet is due west of
                        Assouan.</p>
                    <p>The French have a great problem before them in their vast land-locked Empire
                        in the centre of Africa. With remarkable energy and success they have
                        gradually brought more of the provinces in their sphere of action under
                        oontrol, but the vital question of how to utilize them after the conquest is
                        one which most cause considerable anxiety for a long time to oome. Owing to
                        difficulties of access they are likely to be as valuable as oolonies in the
                        moon. Tripoli is still, and is likely to remain for some time, the best
                        route to the new Frenoh empire. The greatest problem which France has to
                        face</p>

                <cb n="5"/>
                <div type="item">
                    <p>is the finding of means of communication and an outlet for possible trade.
                        Sokoto, Bornu, and Bigirmi are in a fair way towards being settled, but
                        Wadai remains to be oonqaerel. Whichever way they tarn Frenchmen are faced
                        with thousands of miles ot semi desett, dotted only with occasional oases
                        and almost impossible caravan routes through the belt ot the Great Sahara.
                        For a century Tripoli haa been the best and most praotioal opening for trade
                        with the oentre of Africa, for the methods of communicating through Algiers
                        and Tania present apparently insurmountable difficulties. The oaravan routes
                        from Tripoli are practicable, and with very little trouble oould be
                        improved. The 'Parks have never attempted to exercise an active power in
                        Central Africa, confining themselves within their most southern boundary of
                        Fezzan ; bat geographically and through the complete monopoly of trading
                        relations the Hinterlands of Tripoli, including Bornu, Bagirmi, and Wadai,
                        certainly fall to the Sultan. These rights were, of course, ignored by both
                        Great Britain and France when the Convention of 1899 was signified, and the
                        protests of the Saltan of Tarkey went unheeded.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the scheme of capturing the trade of Central Africa and
                        diverting it from the Tripoli route to Tunis has been another of France’s
                        ambitions, for the oaravans pass temptingly close to the Tunisian frontier
                        via Ghadames and Ghat on their way to Bornu and the Western Sadan. It is
                        almost oertaio that a few years ago the Frenoh intended to take in Ghadames,
                        which is a wealthy centre of Arab caravan traders and so tear the frontier
                        as easily to be made a matter of dispute. For no reason which could be
                        justified by the military necessity of paoitying Tunis, the French very
                        quietly established a strong military base at the extreme south of Tonis in
                        Gabes, this town being selected because it possesses excellent water, a
                        rarity in this dry country. Large barracks and hospitals were built and vast
                        stores collected, all being very nnostentatioasly brought with the troops by
                        the regular steamers from Marseilles. No doubt whatever was felt in Tripoli
                        about the intention of the French to seize some portion of it at least, and
                        the Italians themselves were extremely nervous and anxious. They went to the
                        length of picking a qaarrel with the Governor of Benghazi as though to look
                        for oompeQsatiou in that direction.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Sultan became seriously alarmed. With astonishing celerity he
                        despatched steamer after steamer to Tripoli with men and stores, and it was
                        compnted by the Consulat authorities there that in a very few months at
                        least 30,000 Tarkish soldiers had been landed and for the most part
                        immediately hurried off to the Tunisian frontier. ' New forts were bailt,
                        the old ones were repaired, and the harbour of Tripoli was proteo’ed by
                        torpedoes. For some months the Tarkish and Frenoh troops faoed each other at
                        the frontier, and many little Rcidents occurred which could easily have been
                        made the cause of a qaarrel; but the astute diplomacy of the then
                        Governor-General, Rassim Pasha, warded off a corfiiet. For months the
                        position was extremely strained. Measures were being taken in the town of
                        Tripoli itself with a view to protecting the Christians against the rising
                        anger of the Moslem population. But the Turkish position was too strong. The
                        French coaid not master more than 10,COO troops to meet the 30,000 Tarks,
                        who were by no means the andis-o plined horde the Frenoh had had to deal
                        with under the Bey of Tunis. France was evidently not prepared or inolined
                        to undertake an expedition on a large scale, and a joint commission was
                        appointed to delimitate the frontiers, and the inoident ended. The oamp
                        Gabes was deolared unhealthy, and the French troops were gradually
                        withdrawn. Evidenoe of this abortive soheme ia still to be seen in the empty
                        barraoks at Gabea. Bat the ambition to captare the trade with Central Africa
                        still lingers, and many studies were made from Gabes with a view to
                        diverting he trade from Tripoli. Oae of these schemes endei in the fatal
                        termination of the career of the somewhat fanatical Marquis de Morbs, who,
                        while attempting to penetrate into the inferior from Gabes, was murdered
                        only a few days’ march inland by the tribe of the Chaamba. It is evident
                        that the French wilkhe obliged to establish some means of oommnnioation with
                        the Mediterranean coast if they are to benefit by their Central African
                        colonies, through Beughaz: from Wadai and throngh Tanis, failing Tripoli,
                        from Bornu and the Western SudaD. What there may be in the unpublished part
                        of the Franco-Italian agreement, or what understanding may have been arrived
                        at regarding the fature working of the caravan trade with Italy, we do not
                        yet know ; in any case neither ooantry has an enviable task before it. And
                        judging from the news in the telegram the Sultan has taken up a firm stand
                        against all suoh pretensions.</p>

                            captured by the police, and that the authorities are in communication in
                            regard to their trial. It is stated that in oonsequenoe of the prompt

                        <p>FANATICAL OUTBREAK. A Santa correspondent writes that a demonstration
                            against the Christians was made last week at the village of Sonnonres,
                            Fayoum, by mobs of Moslems, who paraded the streets, brandishing
                            nabouts, and with the cry of "Kill or convert” raided the Greek and
                            Coptic shops, and maltreated the shopkeepers. The police intervened in
                            time to check the development of the outbreak, and an enquiry is
                            proceeding. This riot may probably have been due to the conversion of a
                            sheikh to Coptic Christianity. "Al Mokattam” learns that a few days ago
                            some low-class Moslems ot Akhmin, in Upper Egypt, attacked a Coptic
                            funeral in that town and threw stones at the mourners. The aggressors
                            were arrested by the markaz authorities, who have opened an inquiry into
                            the oiroom-stances of the case.</p>

                    <p>MR. FINDLAY'S CHARGES</p>
                    <p>The charges of brilery brought by Mr. Mansfield de C. Findlay in his telegram
                        to Sir E. Grey against the section of the European and vernaoular press
                        which did not hold the same views as the British Agency in regard to the
                        Denishwai affair, are thus commented on by "Al Moayad” :— The British
                        Diplomatic Agency appears to have gone into the Denishwai affair with
                        definite political ends in view. One was to stop Parliament having any voice
                        in Egyptian affairs, and the other was to suppress the liberty of the
                        Egyptian press. What could the British Agency answer if it were asked to
                        prove that the newspapers’ articles showed that they had received a large
                        sum of money as a subsidy ? Has not the British Agency excited the Egyptian
                        Press by the hue and cry it raised and by charging the whole country with
                        fanaticism for whioh the Press is held responsible? How can the papers
                        receive bribes for simply defending themselves ? Who is it who laid out this
                        money? Possibly our contemporary, the "Egyptian Gazette,” would agree with
                        us if we opine that the recent changes in the plans and policy of England in
                        Egypt have baen due to the standpoint which the local Press took up in the
                        Denishwai affair. These opinions of the Press were regarded by Mr. Findlay
                        as severe strictures on the British Administration in Egypt. If on our
                        contemporary refuses to accept this view, and Mr. Findlay remains
                        unconvinced of the true facts as indicated by "Al Moayad,” then we, in our
                        position as a national representative newspaper, will prove the falseness of
                        the charge of the British Charge d’Affaires and will boldly declare that it
                        anyone makes any insinuations of bribery against "Al Moayad’ let him
                        proveit; otherwise, however high be his position, his insinuation mast be
                        considered as a falsehood. "Al Lewa” remarks apropos of Mr. Findlay’s
                        charges, that this is part of the English policy, to attempt to throw
                        discredit on the native Press and thereby to remove the effects whicn the
                        outcry these papers made over the Denishwai affair had in London.</p>

                        have been summoned before their Consols, who warned them against going for
                        walks in the neighbourhood of Mohamed Aly-rqnare in the evening. If they are
                        again observed nootnrnally perambulating they will he sent home to their
                        native lands. All the women undertook to comply with the wishes of the
                        police. Two women, who are believed not be respectable, were arrested last
                        night in company with a European man as they were piomenading in the
                        streets, and despatched to the Italian Consulate.</p>
                    <p>CAIRO POLICE. With reference to a report published in thfl "Egyptian Gszette”
                        of the 27th ultimo headed "Our Berbereen,” it appears that the facts of the
                        case are as follows:— Policemen No. 1131, who was on beat duty at Clot Bey
                        street, seeing a disturbance at Atfet E Suk, went to the spot to see what
                        the matter was. He found an Italian named Giovanni Prola and a native
                        coffee-shop keeper quarrelling, and a knife in the former’s hand. He called
                        ghaffir No. 7, and both took the Italian and native to the oaraool, where a
                        proefes verbal was drawn up against them for brawling. The chief points
                        elioited by the evidence are:— (l) That the policeman was not present when
                        the affair began (according to the Italian and his witnesses, they never saw
                        him at all); (2) The Italian is not more than 40 years of age, and is not
                        the proprietor of the land, whioh belongs to a Copt who looks alter it for
                        his mother ; (3) There is no evidence of the ghaffir striking the Italian;
                        (4) There were no Berbereen present, or at the most there was only one; (5)
                        The "Frenchman” who interfered is known by sight, Oddly and is believed to
                        have been a Qresk. The orderly r fiber who drew up the procks verbal made a
                        note in same to the effeot that the European said to have been attacked was
                        slightly drunk.</p>

                    <head>How Mr. Horton Met His Death</head>
                    <p>Last Friday we published a telegram from a Sohag correspondent reporting the
                        death of Mr. George Hortoh, an inspeotor of the Sleeping Car Company, whose
                        head was cot off while the train on which he was travelling was passing
                        under Kanafi Bridge. From itquirie9 whioh we have made, and from the inqnest
                        whioh was held on Saturday morning at the German Hospital by Mr. A. D.
                        Alban, we have elicited the facts connected with deceased’s terrible death,
                        whioh are as follows :— On Thursday, Mr. Hortob left Lnxor by the 5.30 p.m.
                        train in oharge of the sleeping and restaurant cars. There being but few
                        passengers, the deceased, after dinner, went to the roof of the car, where
                        he sat for some time by himself. It appears that he was aconstomed to travel
                        in this way. Somewhat later he invited Gastave Frohman, maltre d'hotel, to
                        join him on the roof, remarking that to travel in snob a position was most
                        pleasant. Deceased was joined by Frohman, who sat on the top step of the
                        ladder, the former being npon the roof of the sleeping car facing the
                        engine. After remaining there some time Frohman oomplain-ed of the dost,
                        which, he said, blinded him, and went back to the dining-car to get the dost
                        out of his eyes. On returning to join deceased he found that he had changed
                        from the sleeping to the dining oar q^d was sitting with his back to the
                        engine. Mr. Hortob and Frohman then sat side by side, and on reaohing Kanafi
                        Bridge the latter felt something strike his left ear. He bent his he id and
                        Bext saw Mr. Hortob tumbling down head over heels. Frohman desoended to
                        inform the conductor of the sleeping oar, and on arriving at 8ohag, whioh is
                        only twj kilometres distant from the scene of the accident, they returned on
                        a pilot engine and fonnd that the greater part of Hortob’s head was severed
                        from his body, whioh was removed to the Sohag hospital, where the
                        procks-verbal was drawn np. On the following day the body was removed to
                        Cairo, where the inquest was held on Saturday at the German Hospital. The
                        body was identified by Mr. Garriok, a fiiend of the deceased, and Mr.
                        Chaker, chief controller of the company, and permission for bnrial was
                        given, though the inquest was adjourned until Monday in order to take the
                        evidence of Frohman. The body was interred the same morning. Mr. Hortob
                        leaves a widow, who, we regret to say, will be left in very needy oiron
                        instances on aoooont of the terrible death of her husband. We would,
                        therefore, give prominence to the fact that the company are asking for
                        donations in aid of Mrs. Hortob ander these distressing cironmstanoes. Both
                        deceased and his widow are of English nationality, and we hope that the
                        necessary support will be promptly forthcoming. Donations should be
                        addressed to the Cairo office of the Sleeping Car Company, at the
                        station.</p>
                    <p>THE SULTAN</p>
                    <p>AMERICAN OPINION. The ' New York Evening Mail” remarks :— Lately our ministry
                        to Brazil was raised to the grade of an embassy, as a compliment to that
                        oountry. We maintain an ambassador to Mexico for maoh the same reason.
                        Partly this, and partly in order that our representative may not be
                        outranked in either of those American countries by the diplomatic agent of
                        any foreign power. But it is not as a oompliment that we have made onr
                        minister to Turkey an ambassador. Of oonrse it pasres as a distinguished
                        honour, but the motive is really qaite the reverse. Every six months or so
                        the Ottoman Saltan has to he bullied about something. Force is the only
                        international argument that he appreciates. Pressure has to be applied to
                        him by the representative of tha oountry that has business with himj and it
                        is most snooessfally applied by the agent who has the right to walk into the
                        Saltan’s presence. Ambassadors porsess this right: ministers and envoys have
                        the privilege only by the sovereign’s invitation or permission. Mr.
                        Leishman, our representative at the Sublime Porte, is a good
                        Snltan-balldozai, bat he has laboured under the disadvantage of being a mere
                        minister. Congress has made him an ambassador. Now he will be a better
                        ball-dizer than ever, for he can walk into the Saltan’s private office and
                        say, "See here, yonr sublime and ineffable imperial majesty, it is up to yon
                        to do thus and so.” Naturally the Saltan does not appreciate the honour done
                        him in making our minister an ambassador. But if we oorreotly apprehend the
                        character of Mr. Leishman, he will make an early call upon Abdul Hamid jast
                        the same, and will gently but firmly convince him that no other course is
                        open to him. When Uncle Sam decides to honour a Saltan somewhere, that
                        Saltan may as well make up his mind to be honoured.</p>

                    <head>HIS VISIT TO LONDON</head>
                    <head>EXTRAORDINARY SECRETARY</head>
                    <p>A most strange secrecy appears to have been kept in regard to Mustapha Pasha
                        Kamel’s lunch at the Carlton Hotel. The "Daily Express,” for instance,
                        remarks : In the course of the four-and-twenty hours which ended at midnight
                        yesterday, and at a hotel or other publio resort within a hundred miles of
                        Charing Cross, there was held a meeting, conversation, or dinner, at whioh a
                        number of gentlemen, most of whose names we are totally unable to give, met
                        that eminent person Kamel Pasha. We regret being compelled to put this
                        absorbing item of news before onr readers in such a form, as we are
                        conscious that the report lacks precision, but such extraordinary
                        precautions seem to have been taken to ensure secrecy that we cannot do
                        otherwise. It is true an "official” report of the proceedings was issued
                        —but then it is only an "official” report. As it happens, however, the
                        secrecy of the proceedings does not render them less interesting, or, if we
                        may say so, less significant. Yet we are puzzled to account for it. What
                        possible reason can our Little Englander friends have for maintaining
                        secrecy ? It cannot be that they are ashamed of their views, for, as we are
                        aware, they glory in demonstrating to the world how often and how utterly
                        their native country is in the wrong. We oan only suppose that, out of
                        compliment to Kamel Pasha, it was arranged to give the proceedings as much
                        of the air of a little conspiracy as possible. We do not imagine that
                        dreadful things passed at the meeting. It is highly improbable that the
                        guests circulated a oup of blood, after the manner libellonnly imputed to
                        that pre-Canarian Canar, Catiline, and it is even questionable if the green
                        flag was elevated above the Union Jaok amid thunderous cheers for Mahomet.
                        What is more likely is that the missioner of New Egypt was bathed in a
                        congenial atmosphere of "hot air,” and that, like the noble animal whose
                        name he bears, the personage of the evening comported himself with much
                        droll dignity. The Kamel of Nationalism has set out on a protracted journey.
                        His ways may be devious, and his goal obscure, but his time cannot be
                        considered to be wholly wasted if he succeeded yesterday in pawing some sand
                        into the eyes ot a small section of the British public. Let ns hope that his
                        futile efforts will give him his namesake’s proverbial "hump.” The following
                        is the text of the speech of Mr. John M. Robertson, M. P. for Tyneside, of

                        <p>The following is the report of the direotors to be presented to the
                            shareholders at the ordinary general meeting to be held on Thurs day,
                            16th inst.:— Land Purchases.—At the close of the period ended 30th
                            September, 1905, the area of lands purchased aggregate! 479,275 feddans,
                            at a total cost of £127,950, in addition to a one sixth interest in
                            valuable property in the Province of Qharbieh comprising 1,577 feddans.
                            The principal properties are in the neighbourhood of Cairo, Tantah,
                            Behra, and other important towns and villages. During the half-year
                            under review, a farther 30,178 feddans of land have been purchased at a
                            total oost of £4,320 12s. 3d. Also an interest in other properties,
                            consisting of land, building, at a cost of £164,102 Ils. 3d. The total
                            amount of purchases made by the company at 31st March 1906, was £305,990
                            9s. 7d., on which deferred payments amounting to £104,695 7. 7d. still
                            had to be met. The whole of the purchases made are shown in the balance
                            sheet at oost price plus interest on deferred payments. Development
                            andSales.—The development of our properties has been steadily pushed
                            forward and at the end of March, 1906, the first of the oompauy’s land
                            sales was held, the results, after allowing for cost of drainage, roads,
                            being in the opinion of the directors most satisfactory. As these sales
                            were held at and after the dose of the half year, and only small amounts
                            on deposit had at that date been received, the results do not appear in
                            the accounts presented. Working Expenses.—The working expenses have been
                            kept at the lowest possible minimum, pending results of sales of lands.
                            The total, inoludiDg direotors’ fees, secretary, clerksge, and rent of
                            offices—London and Egypt — amounts to only £887 8s. 8d. Revenue, derived
                            from interest on oash deposits, rents and sales of crops, amount ed to
                            £4,211 18s. 6d., which, after allowing for working and administrative
                            expenses, left a balance of 3,324 9s. lOd. From this was deducted the
                            loss as shewn at 30th September 1905, viz, £779 5s. Od., leaving a nett
                            balance of £2,545 4s. lOi. to be carried forward. As ha9 before been
                            stated, the proceeds of land sales, held at and since the end of March,
                            have not been taken into consideration, but will appear in the next
                            accounts issaed. General —The directors are satisfied that the land
                            purchases whioh have been made are sound, and steps are being taken to
                            re-open the sales of theproperty at the end of this year when the slack
                            season in Egypt is over. These sale?, it is anticipated, will show
                            considerable profits Vacancy on the Board,—The directors regret to have
                            to record the loss by death of their oolleague Sir Elwin Palmer, K.C.B.,
                            K.C.M.G., one of the original directors of this company. Mr. J. W.
                            Williamson has been appointed in his place. Directors.—Sir Auokland
                            Colvin, K.C.S.I, and Baron J. de Menasce retire by rotation, and, being
                            eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Auditors.—The proprietors
                            will be asked to eleot auditors for the ensuing year. The firm of
                            Messrs. Frank Davies, Meredith Co. having divided, the Directors
                            recommend that Messrs. Meredith and Co., who are eligibe, and have
                            offered themselves for eleotion, shall be appointed. The following is
                            the profit and loss aocount from 80th September, 1905, to 31st Meroh
