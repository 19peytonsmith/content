                            tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only requires
                            the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and easily applied
                            with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third the cost of paint.
                            HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals
                            alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>

                            to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all the
                            advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the cost of oil
                            paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that it can be washed
                            adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                       <p>THE ROYAL VISIT TO INDIA</p>
                        <p>While the Prince and Princess of Wales are
                        passing through the Suez Canal en route to 
                        the East, the elder members of the British
                        community in Egypt will no doubt recall the
                        interest that was excited by the departure of
                        our present King, the Prince of Wales, for
                        the East in 1875. Then the royal itinerary 
                        included Cairo, and the Prince rejoined the
                        transport Serapis at Suez, reaching Aden on 
                        the 1dt of November and Bombay on the 8th,
                        the eve of his birthday. The present
                        Prince of Wales will reach Bombay on that
                        auspicious date and we do not doubt that
                        the 9th of November will be celebrated with
                        even greater manifestations of joy and patrio-
                        ism than usual, owing to the presence among
                        our fellow-subjects of the Heir-Apparent and 
                        his gracious consort.</p>
                        <p>Since the last Egypt and India have 
                            changed. Under the enlightened rule of H.H.
                            the Khedive and the guidance of Lord Cromer
                            and a devoted and energetic band of officials,
                            Egypt, from a bankrupt despotism, has become 
                            one of the most enlightened and progressive of
                            Oriental states. The Sudan, once a province
                            where corrupt and tyrannous officials made
                            their fortunes or lost their lives, a drain on
                            Egypt's resources and a breeding ground for the 
                            forces of violence and fanaticism which were to
                            lay it desolate, has become a well-governed
                            and promising country, to-day a useful recruit-
                            ing ground and a valuable commercial asset,
                            to-morrow one of the most productive regions
                            of Africa. In Egypt, as in the Sudan, justice
                            has been purified, education is making great 
                            strides, and in all that concerns the material
                            side of human development the country has 
                            progressed astonishingly since 1875.</p>
                            <p>India, too, has changed, though the history 
                                of India shows more ups and downs, more
                                alternations of war and famine with peace and
                                prosperity, than that of Egypt in the last
                                generation. Upper Burmah has been annexed;
                                Mysore has been restored to its royal houses,
                                and remains a well-managed and in some ways
                                a model principality; the industrial and com-
                                mercial development of the country has in-
                                creased enormously; railway communications 
                                have been extended, and despite the savage
                                backwardness of some and the proud con
                                servatism of others among the many races of our

                                degree the development of the Indian Empire.

                                still require the vigilant watch of our
                                frontier garrisons, Anglo-Indian armies have
                                entered Kabul and Kandshar, Mandalay and
                                Lhassa, and events beyond the N.W. frontier
                                have made a reorganisation of the Indian Army
                                a necessity. It is unfortunate that this reor-
                                ganisation should have led to a dispute be-
                                tween one of the ablest of British soliders and

<p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 26.
Immense meetings of students, workmen, 
and others took place yesterday evening in
the University. Revolutionary speeches were
delivered calling on the people to rise in arms.

<p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 26.</p>
<p>The railway strike is general throughout
European Russia, and all trades are paralized. 
3,000 passengers at Moscow, unable to proceed
on account of the strike are being fed and 
sheltered by authorities. Tradesmen are
exasperated at the dislocation of business. At
the conclusion of a Council of Ministers held
at Peterhoff, the Ministers were conveyed to 
St. Petersburg in an Imperial Yacht, as they 
were unable to return by rail.</p> 
<p>There has been a conflict at Nicolai station
between the strikers and several  engine-drivers 
who were desirous of taking out a train. Revo-
vers were used and there are several killed and
injured.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s fighting at Ekaterinaslav
between the troops and the crowd there were
15 killed and 26 injured.</p>
<p>The editors of newspapers are discussing
the advisability of publishing everything re-
gardless of the censorship. (Reuter)</p>
<p>WARSAW, October 26.</p>
<p>The city is completely isolated except tele-
graphically. A famine of meat, milk, and coal
is feared. (Reuter)</p>
    
<p>St. Petersburg, October 26.
Disorders broke out here this morning.
Several shops were plundered. Tho streets are
crowded with-workmen, and the shops are
rapidly, closing.</p>
<p>The Cossacks dispersed a meeting of 7,000
workmen, wounding a hundred. Eight Cossacks
were injured by stones. The railway bridge over
the Obvodny Canal has been destroyed. Else-
where the city is quiet, overawed by the strong
display of troops. Two track loads of arms and
ammunition which arrived at tho terminus of
the Finnish Railway in the morning were
carried off before the police arrived to seize
them.</p>
<p>The Council of Ministers has definitely
decided in favor of the formation of a Cabinet.
The Premier will be entitled to propose mi-
nisterial appointments, except for Foreign
Affairs, War, and Marine.</p>
<p>An Imperial decree, countersigned by the
Grand Dake Vladimir, commanding the St.
Petersburg district, places the garrison of the
city under the orders of General Trepoff. (R.)</p>

       <head>THE JAPANESE TREATY.</head>
       <head> LORD ROSEBERY'S VIEWS.</head>
<p>London, October 26.
Lord Rosebery, speaking at Stourbridge,
said that the Japanese treaty is an engine of
tremendous power but that it will probably
lead to countless animosities. Nevertheless,
with good men at the helm, we shall be able
to defeat all hostile combinations. The agree-
ment with France has received a much more
unanimous assent from the nation. He regret-
ted that its conclusion had been the occasion
of a bitter animosity to Germany, which con-
stiiutes a serious danger to the peace of the
world.	(Reuter)</p></div>

<p>Old Daira Sanieh Offices. — We hear
that the old officies of tho Daira Sanieh, for

ment Co. were in treaty, have been taken by
Messrs. Barclay, Hinks & Co.</p>
<p>Thief Killed.—A party of thieves recently
broke into the ezbeh of Ibrahim Bey Fuad,
near Delingat, and were attempting to carry
off some cotton when the ghaffir fired into
their midst and shot one of them dead. The
rest made off but the Mulahiz of Delingat,
hearing the news, went in pursiuit of them
and captured another.</p>
<p>The Train de Luxe.—We understand that
in consequence of the already heavy passenger
traffic between Cairo and Luxor, the Railway.
Administration have decided to run the train,
de luxe, composed entirely of sleeping cars
and a restaurant-car, on alternate days, from
November 15, this date being a fortnight
earlier thanin former years.</p>
<p>A Fatal Window — In a previous issue we
mentioned a tragic event which had occurred
in the Bab el-Sharieh Cairo, where a married 
couple, apparently in consequence of a quarrel,
fell from a window into the street, the wife
being killed and the husband dangerously 
hurt. The latter has since seccumbed to his
injuries, and now we learn that his sister, 
becoming frantic with grief at her brother's 
and his wife’s death, has flung herself head 
first from the fatal window, receiving severe |
but not dangerous injuries.</p>

<p>Don Muzzling Order. — In view of th
fact that 17 cases of rabies have been reported 
in Alexandria during the year 1905 the
Alexandria Municipality have decided to en-
force Article III. of the Regulations on Dogs,
and have issued an order to the office that all
dogs in the streets must either be muzzled or
led. The muzzle must be of one of the descrip-
tions which are to be seen at the Municipality's
central sanitary office. Owners of dogs are
given one month,i.e., until the 27th November,
to conform to this regulation. Infringements
after that date will be severely punished.</p>

cess of Wales on board, arrived here at 3.30
p.m. The vessel moored opposite the Canal
Company’s office at 4 p m. As the Renown
entered the harbour both the Princes and Prin-
cess worn to be seen on tho bridge. The latter
carried a Kodak, while the Prince was engaged
with a telescope.</p>
<p>From fifty to seventy-five small craft assem-
bled to meet the Renown in the harbour, and
followed her to her mooring. The quay is
gaily decorated with flags and bunting and
looks very striking and pretty. The Port
Said and Suez Coal Co. and Messrs. Cory Bros.
& Co. made an especially fine display with
flags.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Suffolk arrived at 3.45 and moored
alongside the Surprise in Navy Bay.
A number of visits have been paid on
H.M.S. Renown by the local authorities, in-
cluding H.E. the Governor.</p>

                    <head>THE RENOWN.</head>
<p>The furnishing and decoration of the prin-
cipal Royal apartments, on the Renown have
been carried out by Waring & Gillow, Ltd.,
who, it will be remembered, also prepared
the Ophir for their Royal Highnesses' visit
to the Colonies. The treatment throughout is
of a simple character that is characterised by
the refinement which Waring & Gillow inva-
riably associat with their decorative work.
The Princess's day saloon, with the bedroom
and bathroom attached, is upholstered with
cream challis having a boarder of pink rosebuds,
and the electric lights have pink shades to
match. Tho fore-cabin, or dining room, is up-
holstered With curtains of French tissue
bordered with pale blue. The furniture in this
room is practioally the same as it was before
the vessel was commissioned for his Royal
Highness’s voyage, but several fine mezzotint
engravings were sent from York Cottage,
and a baudsome arrangement of electric can-
delabra for the table was added.</p>
<p>The after-cabin, or drawing room, is furnish-
ed in an effective French tissue of pink and
blue, the table cloths are pale blue bordered
with white silk and fringe, and the curtains are
of the same material as those in the dining-
room, the electric lights being enclosed in
opaque glass with shades of pink.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales’s bedroom is upholster-
ed with a handsome printed linen, the furni-
ture being of fine mahogany.</p>
                    <p>The apartments throughout are painted in
white enamel and have plated fittings, and
electric fans are provided in each, while those
occupied by the Prince, and Princess have
heating apparatus in addition.</p>
<p>The floors of all the apartments are covered
with very fine matting. Numerous semi-struc-
tural alterations have been made for the accom-
modation of the Commodore and the suite, the
bridge-house having, for instance, been divided
into two rooms which will serve as lounge and
reading rooms. These are furnished in oak
with blue curtains trimmed with white.
The whole of the deck is covered with cork
matting so that it will serve as cool promenade.</p></div>

                    <head>NATIONAL HOTELS & RESIDENCES</head>
<p>Under the above title a new company is to
be launched in Cairo next month through the

toine Bey Sabbagh, Mr. Sidney Davis, of
Messrs. S. Davis and Sons, London, Valle Bey,
formerly of the Egyptian Postal Administra-

Mr. Charles Bauer. The capital is L.E. 200,000,
divided in 50,000, shares, of L.E. 4 each,
besides 2,000 Fouders’ shares. Of the above
only 30,000 shares will be offered to the
public, the remainder having been already
privately subscribed.</p>
<p>The company has been formed to a quire
the National Hotel, in the Sharia Soliman
Pasha, Cairo, with the block of residences
adjoining, both buildings contatining about
350 rooms, as well as the Hotel-Casino
at Ain Sofar, in the Lebanon, with the
surrounding property, which contains some
mineral springs. According to the statutes,
after payment of all expenses and placing of
the statuary amount to reserve, the share-
holders will be entitled to a preferential
dividend of 5 per cent. Of the balance, 8O
percent goes to the shareholders and 20 per
cent to the holders of Founders’ shares.
Next summer the company intend issuing to
residents combined through tickets, which will
include rail and steamer fares between any
town in Egypt and the Lebanon and residence
at the Ain Sofar Hotel, which will be con-
siderably enlarged.</p></div>

<head>NEW BRITISH CLUB FOR 
    ALEXANDRIA.</head>
<p>We are glad to hear that there is every 
likelihood of a British Club being formed in
Alexandria before the New Year. There are
many young Englishmen now established in
this town, and their number is annually in-
creasing. At present there is no place
whore they can meet in the evening to
enjoy that club life which is so dear to the
Englishman's heart, so any attempt seriously
made to form a suitable club will no doubt
meet with wide sympathy. There must of
course be a well-stocked reading-room, billiard
and card-rooms, and a bar, and these we see
are included int he scheme. Some difficulty may
arise about finding a suitable "locale,” but on
this point the gentlemen who reply favorably
to the circular which has just been issued by
the promoters will be consulted.</p>

                    <p>It is obviously impossible to reach all
would-be members by means of a circular, so
it is hoped that those who receive the circular
will mention the matter to their friends and
let it be known that application forms may be
obtained from any of the provisional committee,
which is composed of Admiral:- Sir Massie
Blomfield, K.C.M.G., Captain Borton, Mr. P.
W. Carver, Mr. R C. Crafton, Mr.K. P. Birley,
Mr. W. F. Sarjeant, Mr. P. A. Malone, Mr.
H. S. Martin, and Mr. A. R. Purvis, hon. sec.
(pro tem). This committee will only act until
a general meeting can be called to elect its
own committee.</p>
                   
<p>It is evident no club can be started without
a sufficient number of promises to join, and
as tho annual subscription is fixed at P.T. 150,
tho club will be within the reach of all. That
a sufficient sum for furnishing the club is to be
given as a free gift is an encouraging feature
for it is essential that the club be bright and
well-furnished, and not start with a debt on its
shoulders.</p></div>

                    <head>THE MECCA PILGRIMAGE.</head>
                    <head>REGULATIONS' CONCERNING
                        EXPENSES.</head>
<p>The Ministry of the Interior have issued a
a note relative to the expenses incurred by the
pilgrims who accompany the Mahmal to Mecca.
The accounts which have been drawn up by,
the Ministry of Finance show that last year the
travelling expenses of the pilgrims accompany-
ing the Mahmal exceeded the sum deposited,
by them for the defraying of such expenses, and
the Government has had to pay the excess.
"The surplus” according to the text of the
note, “has become such a heavy charge that the
Government cannot support it." It has therefore
boon decided to increase by a small amount
the sum to be deposited by each pilgrim who
wishes to accompany the Mahmal, but should
the amount thus deposited exceed the expenses
of the journey the surplus will be reimbursed to
the pilgrims.</p>
<p>This note also draws attention to the fact that
in former years, in consequence of the existence
of plague in Egypt, the Sanitary Board of
Constantinople subjected pilgrims going to
the Hedjax, to a preliminary quarantine, which,
with the disinfection, gave rise to the levy of a
maximum tax of L.E. 50 per pilgrim. This tax
was payable at Suez and caused considerable 
embarrassment to the pilgrims who did not.
know beforehand that such a call would be
made upon them.</p>
                    <p>The Government has therefore decided that
this sum must be deposited in advance, as
well as the L.E. 56 ordinarily deposited for the
quarantine expenses on the return journey by
all the pilgrims who do not accompany the
Mahmal.</p>
                    <p>Under such conditions the pilgrim will have
already paid all expenses, be it for disinfection
at Suez, or Tor, or for the preliminary quaran-
tine, and will not have to further concern
himself with the payments of tho different taxes
for these several operations. If quarantine on
the way to Mecca and disinfection are not
necessary, as there is every reason to hope will
be the case this year, the excess amount
deposited by the pilgrim will be refunded to
him on his return.</p></div>

                    <head>SALVINI AS “HAMLET.”</head>
<p>Cavaliere Salvini, who is at present occupy-
ing the boards of the Zizinia Theatre, took
his “benefit" last night, when he appeared
in Shakespeare’s sublime tragedy Hamlet.
The occasion was a veritable triumph for
the great Italian tragedian. Although some
little exception might be taken to the pro-
duction as a whole, there was no gainsaying
the power of Salvini’s impersonation of the
Prince of Denmark. His conception of Hamlet
differed from those we have been accustomed
to see on the English stage in that there
was little of that melancholia with which
the character is generally invested. From
the days of Kemble downwards, our Hamlets
have all suffered too much of the megrims.
They have had too strong an affinity with
the Stranger. But "melancholy,” in the case
of Hamlet, is not the word. The King and
Queen think, or prefer to pretend to think,
that he is melancholy ; but Hamlet is really
enbittered, soured, indignant It is not the
loss of his father that is “within” him and
passes show in the first act, but the haunt-
ing suspicions which arise within his "pro-
phetic soul,” the desperate disillusion caused
by his mother's indecent haste to marry
again, and the ruin of his own prospects. A
man so beset with mind troubles is not
melancholy ; he is overstrung. As a protest
against the old, slow, pump-handle preachy
than acceptable, interesting, and .thrilling.
There were moments last night when Salvini
rose to the greatest heights of his wonderful
genius, and kept his audience absolutely spell-
bound. The scene with his terrified mother
in the fourth act was a masterpiece of dramatic
art. Cavaliere Salvini laboured under the 
heavy disadvantage of a bad cold, but his 
magnificent elocution was not for a single 
instant impaired, and the thunders of applause 
which greeted each fall of the curtain de-
monstrated the great hold the actor had ob-
tained over his auditors. Sig. Cesare Olivieri
was a spirited 'Laertes. Sig. Camillo Aureli 
was careful and commendable, but hardly 
pompons and self-important enough as Polonius
and Sig. Giyola was'an. inoffensive- Horatio. (
Sig. Diaz emphasised the villainy of Claudius
in make-up and manner, but his performance 
was hardly convincing. Signa. Fortuzzi-Podda 
was a fragile and sympathetic Ophelia, and 
was particularly effective in the "mad” scene;
while Signa. Aliprandi made a very natural 
but not altogether imposing Queen. The 
mounting of the piece was not all that it might
have been, but any defeats in that respect were
fully made up for by the brilliance of Cav.
Salvini’s performance.</p>
<p>To-morrow night-Salvini will appear in The
    Taming of the Shrew.</p></div>

                    <head>MAJOR-GEM. SIR CHARLES WILSON</head>
<p>LONDON, October 26.
Major-General Sir Charles Wilson is dead. 
(Reuter)</p>
</p>The death of this distinguished officer re-
moves from the scene one of the leading figures
of the Nile expedition of 1884.5. Born at 
Liverpool on the 14th March, 1836, and
educated at Cheltenham College, young Wilson 
gave the first proof of his remarkable abilities
by passing the second in the first open competition
for admission to the Royal Engineers. He was
promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1855 (at 
the early age of nineteen) and from 1858 
to 1862 acted as a Secretary to the North
American Boundary Commission. His sur-
vets of Jerusalem and Palestine, 1864-66,
brought him further credit, and his work
on the Ordnance Survey of Scotland, 1866-68,
and as assistant commissioner of the Borough
Boundary Commission added to his reputation.
In 1868-69 he surveyed the Sinai Peninsula,
and was immediately afterwards appointed
Director of the Topographical Department of
the War Office and A.Q.M.G of the Intelli-
gence Department. He was elected F.R.S in
1874 and the rank of C.B (civil) was conferred
on him in 1877 for his services in the organisa-
ion of the Intelligence Department. After
work on Royal Commissions and the Ordnance
Survey of Ireland he was appointed British
Commissioner of the Servan Boundary Com-
mission, and Consul-General in Anatolia, and 
was sent on a special mission to Eastern Rou-
melia in 1880. In the Egyptian campaign of 
1882 Sir Charles Wilson joined Lord Wolse-
ley as D.A.G., Intelligence Department, and 
on January 8 joined the Desert Column 
with orders to proceed with Lord Charles
Beresford to Khartoum after the occu-
patron of Metemmeh, and deliver a letter
from Lord Wolseley to General Gordon. After
distinguishing himself at Abon Kles, where he
helped to rescue Sir Herbert Stewart from
three dervishes, he took over the command on 
the 18th January, after Sir Herbert Stewart
had been wounded, and led the force that had 
to fight for the Nile and water on that memo-
table day. On January 24 he started up for 
Khartoum in command of two “penny
steamers” containing crews and soldiers absolu-
tele without discipline, and twenty English 
soldiers. All the world knows the story of
that desperate venture, that came, alas
just too late. Sir Wilson recrossed the
Bayed steppe, a distance of 175 miles, in four 
days, riding 60 miles on the last day, and 
brought the news of the safety of the steamers.
He received the thanks of the Government for
his services, the Sudan medal with two clasps
and the decoration of K.C.B. Shortly after his
return to England he wrote “From Korti to 
Khartoum,” one of the best descriptions of the
experiences of the desert column extant.
Sir Charles Wilson became Director-General
of the Ordnance Survey from 1886 to 1894,
and in 1895 became Director General of Mili-
tary Education, retiring in 1898. From 1897
to 1902 he was Vice-President of the Royal
Geographical Society, having twice presided
over the meetings of the geographical section
of the British Association. Among his works
were “Picturesque Palestine” and “the Life of 
Lord Clive” (Men of Action series), and he
edited Murray’s handbooks to Asia Minor and 
Constantinople. He was created K.C.M.G in 
1881 and held the additional distinctions of 
D.C.L (oxon), LL.D. (Edin), M.E. (Dublin), 
besides being a fellow of the Royal and of the 
Royal Geographical Societies.</p></div>

<p>The E.T.C staff opened their football season

ing with the wind in the first half, the E.T.C. 
did most of the pressing, and though the home
goalkeeper had several shots to negotiate the
teams crossed over with a blank sheet. In 
the second half the play was more evenly 
divided, the visitors having reconstructed 
their forward line, but it was not until two
minutes from time that Byrne, from a pass by
Collier, scored the only goal of the match;
the E.T.C. thus winning by one to nil. The
home team had bad luck in the second half
and should certainly have scored. Gunner
Davis played a fine back game for the “Dep-
artments,” and the trio of E.T.C. halves did
excellently ; their defencs and that of “Lees at
back being mainly responsible for their win.</p></div>
