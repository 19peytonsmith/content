                 <p> It will not be many yearn before the isolation
                 of the Egyptian railway system becomes a
                 thing of the past. The Khedive's railway is
                 gradually creeping towards the Tripolitan
                 frontier, while the northward march of the
                 Cape to Cairo line is always moving Railhead
                 nearer and nearer. Meanwhile, the develop-
                 ment of the railway communications in Syria
                 is proceeding apace and for several months past
                 the French Embassy at Constantinople has been

                 <div type="item"> <p> negotiating with the Ports on the subject of
                 the construction of a line from Damascus to
                 Hamah, and from Hamah to Aleppo, by a
                 French company. The concession has at last
                 been granted, in spite of the efforts which the
                 Germans made to render the project abortive.
                 The proposed line is not a long one, but its
                 oommercial importance will be very marked.
                 Aleppo is a great trading centre, and the sur-
                 rounding conntry is very rich. Hitherto.no
                 line has connected the town with the Syrian
                 coast, and the new railway will therefore
                 afford a valuable outlet for the agricul-
                 tural produce and manufactures of the dis-
                 trict. The French are all the more delighted
                 at the succcess of M. Constans in obtaining
                 the concessions for the French company, since
                 the Germans have done their utmost at Con-
                 stantinople to include Aleppo in the coontry
                 to be served by the Bagdad railway, and to
                 induce the Saltan to forbid the construction
                 of any other railway near the town. The traffic
                 of the district, instead of going by the Bagdad
                 line, will now be tapped by the more natural
                 way of Beyrout. In granting the concession
                 the Sultan said that he did so in order that
                 the ancient and traditional friendship between
                 turkey and France might receive a new con-
                 firmation. It is evident that some suspicions
                 have entered the Sultan's mind that the
                 Kaiaer’s attitude towards him is not altogether
                 disinterested, at least so far as relates to Asia
                 Minor. The linking of the Syrian and Egyptian
                 railway systems will Inevitably come to pass and
                 few engineering difficulties attend the con-
                 struction of a line by the short desert route
                 via Kantara and Gaza to the Jaffa-Jerusalem
                 line. It may not be many years before there
                 will be through communioation from Cairo to
                 Calais via Constantinople and Vienna.</p>

            <p>Tokio, January 4.</p>
            <p>The terms of the surrender are contained in
            eleven articles. The garrison and officials are
            prisoners. All the forts and war materials are
            to be transferred to the Japanese. If the Rus-
            sians destroy anything, the negotiations are to
            be annulled, and Japan will then be free to take
            action. The Russians are to give plans of the
            fortifications and mines. Considering the
            gallant resistance made by the place, the Rus-
            sian officers are to be permitted to keep their
            swords and private property. On giving their
            parole, they will be allowed to return to
            Russia. The rank and file in uniform, with
            their portable property, are to assemble, under
            their respective officers, in a place indicated
            by the Japanese. The sanitary corps and the
            accountants are to be retained in order to
            assist in caring for the sick and wounded.</p>
            <p>Russian officers who have reached Chifu
            state that Stoessel's army was originally
            35,000 of whom 11,000 have been killed, and
            16,000 are sick or wounded. There were 8,000
            in the forts, 2,000 of whom were unable to
            fight. During the siege, 265% of the garrison
            were “hors do combat." This remarkable fact
            is due to the wounded having returned to
            the front</p>

            yesterday evening by a crowd of about 200
            persons for the purpose of discussing the

            of the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Com-
            pany. The meeting began at about 8.30 p.m.,
            when the chairman, Mr. Benjamin Arbib,
            made a statement as to the attitude which
            the board of directois had taken up towards
            the committee of Ramlehites, who had en-
            deavoured to set their grievances before
            them. He said that all the inhabitants of
            Ramleh should demand the maintenance of
            the former season-tickct system. This was
            the one aud only programme which the com-
            mittee would ask the board to take into con-
            sideration, as although there were many
            questions pending between the population of
            Ramleh and the company, these did not ne-

            expressed himself as being in hearty agreement
            with the opinions of the chairman.</p>
            <p>Many other speakers followed and gavo vont
            to a number of various and conflicting sugges-
            tions for settling the question at issue.</p>
            <p>Chevalier Rouci, chairman of the Tenants'
            Defence Committee, then rose and, in an im-
            passioned oration in Italian, announced that
            the cause of Ramleh was also the cause of the
            committee over which he presided.</p>
            <p>Mr. Geo. B. Alderson shortly afterwards ar-
            rived on the scene and was greeted with
            acclamation. A scene of great enthusiasm
            followed, and afterwards Mr. Alderson’s scheme
            for settling the problem was given forth to the
            meeting in Italian by Mr. Quintavalle.</p>
            <p>The meeting broke up at 11 p.m. All the
            persons attending the meeting refused to pay
            their fares both on going and coming to the
            meeting. The employes of the Company did
            not make any fuss.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>THIS MORNING'S DEVELOPMENTS.</head>
            <p>Great excitement prevailed on the line this
            morning. The meeting last night was the
            subject of universal discussion by the passen-
            gers. As a large number persisted in refusing
            to pay the fare the company was obliged to
            seek for the assistanoe of the Alexandria City
            Police. Fifteen policemen were placed at the
            service of the company in order to draw up
            “proces-verbaux" in cases of non-payment of
            fares. Some angry Ramlehites tried to rush
            through the cordon of police and a scene of
            considerable excitement ensued. But the
            majority of them accepted the situation with
            an air of peaceful resignation and agreed to
            pay tho fares. The police were stationed at
            the gate of the station and asked each passen-
            ger arriving from Ramleh for his or her ticket</p>
            <p>As we go to press we learn that matters are
            proceeding quietly and that no serious distur-
            bance has as yet taken place. We understand,
            however, that the agitators do not intend to
            let things resume their normal course unless
            the directors give way, and that other mani
            festations against the new system will take
            place shortly.</p>
            <p>The committee of Ramlehites will meet the
            directors to-day, in order to ascertain from
            them if they intend to bow to the wishes of the
            inhabitants. Another general public meeting of
            Ramlehites will be held on Saturday evening
            next at 9 o’clock at the Bacos Theatre.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>“G.B." AND THE SITUATION.</head>
            <p>Mr. Geo. B. Alderson writes:—The company
            have right on their side, to a certain extent.
            I have noticed how travellers look at the
            "oommissaires" and say “Abonne.” They may
            have been, as myself, an abonne for 40 years,
            but the commissaire may have been employed
            40 hours only and knows not the “Abonne"
            of 40 years. I have also noticed how tra-
            vellers take tickets to Ibrahimieh and go past
            it, and if asked, pay the difference. Control,
            under these conditions, is difficult for the
            company. Their right to annul season tickets
            without giving a “quid proquo” I dispute—and
            should wish to have it brought before tribunals
            to decide. But I suggest, to meet all parties
            amicably, that the company issue to all
            residents or householders who wish to be
            abonnes and have a right at old price ‘‘carnets’’
            special for 3, 6, 9, or 12 months, calculated
            at 4 journeys per day. Each "carnet" to be
            for 3, 6, 9, or 12 months, paid in advance
            and every ticket dated and personal, but
            each quarter the "carnet” to be returned to the
            company, and any tickets unusrd to be accept-
            ed back by the company at 50% on its value.</p></div>

            <head>REPORTED REDUCTION.</head>
            <head>(From our own Correspondent)</head>
            <p>Port-Said, Thursday.</p>
            <p>Although as yet not officially admitted, I
            have it on reliable authority that it has been
            decided in Paris to reduce the Canal dues from
            8 fes. 50 cms. per ton to 8 fes. Bridge deck
            dues will still be charged.</p>
            <p>The date on which the reduction will come
            into force is not yet known.</p>
            <p>On the 31st ulto. 13 vessels psssed through
            the Canal, viz., 7 British, 1 Austrian, 1 French,
            1 Norwegian, 1 German, 2 Dutch; the re-
            ceipts for the day being frs. 852,274.76.</p>
            <p>The returns for the year 1904 show that
            during the twelve months ended December 31,
            4,257 ships entered the Canal, the total amount
            received in dues being 114,875,154.68 frs,
            an increase of frs 12,292,113.41 over the
            preceding year. In 1903 the number of ships
            passing through the canal was 3,775. The year
            just closed, therefore, shows an increase in the
            total, as compared with 1903, of 482 vessels, a
            considerable advance on last year’s figures,
            which only showed an excess of 67 when com-
            pared with 1902. If we take the number of
            ships returned during the past six years as
            having used the Canal the great increase in
            number during 1904 beoomes still more marked,
            the respective totals being:-</p>
            <p>1899-	3,607	1902-3,708
            1900-	3,441	1903—3,775

            <p>The steamer "Worcestershire" having proved
            herself such a complete success, and commend-
            ed herself to the many passengers by her on
            her maiden voyage, Messrs. Bibby Brothers
             Co., have placed with Messrs. Harland &amp;
            Wolff of Belfast, an order for a sister ship, to
            be called the "Herefordshire,” the construction
            of which is now being proceeded with. With the
            advent of this steamer, the “Lancashire" and
            “Yorkshire," which have in the past done such
            good service in the line, will drop out as soon
            as possible—indeed they will not again appear
            in the lists for the busy season, either outwards
            or homewards. The Bibby Line will therefore
            in future be composed entirely of twin screw
            steamers of the most up-to-date type. Outward
            passengers via Marseilles will be glad to know
            that it has been arranged that they can now
            leave London a day later, say on the Thursday
            morning, embarkation at Marseilles being fixed
            for noon on Friday. This extension of time
            will not alter the time at which the steamers
            will arrive in the East, which will be as here-
            tofore.</p></div>

            <head>TEXT OF GOVERNMENT NOTE.</head>
            <p>The following is a translation of ths Note
            issued yesterday by the Egyptian Govern-
            ment:-</p>
            <p>The different measures taken by the Egyptian
            Government with regard to persons desiring to
            make the pilgrimage to the Holy Places have
            been prompted by two motives:</p>
            <p>1.	To insure tho greatest freedom and
            facilities to all who wish to fulfil this sacred
            duty, while guarding them from all useless
            expenditure and from the dangers of the
            journey, and giving them all the medical
            attention that their health during the pilgrim-
            age may necessitate.</p>
            <p>2.	To control the return of the pilgrims
            with a view to the avoidance of epidemics,
            which are always possible. In this connection
            the circular addressed to all moudirs and
            governors on November 16, 1904, deserves to
            be noted. This circular states that every
            Egyptian has the right to make the pilgrimage
            whenever his means allow of it, and that if he
            fears to travel alone the Government gives
            him the opportunity of accompanying the
            Mehtmal, being anxious to make the pilgrimage
            as easy as possible.</p>
            <p>Last year the same measures were taken and
            600 pilgrims asked to be allowed to accompany
            the Mahmal. This year 1,614 had inscribed
            their names on the list of those desirous to
            accompany the Mahmal before it was closed.</p>
            <p>Those who have already left for the Hedjaz
            admit that the oooditions imposed on the
            pilgrims who accompany the Mahmal are
            pecuniarily the most advantageous, not to
            mention the advantages of military protection
            and medical assistance.</p>
            <p>If the pilgrim travels alone he must make a
            deposit of P.T. 156 at the Moudirieh whence
            he draws his passport, of which P.T. 100
            represents the rations given him by the Go-
            vernment in the quarantine camp at Tor and
            P.T. 56 the quarantine expenses. If, as is
            usually the case, he travels 3rd class, he will
            have to pay some LE 5 for his return ticket
            on the Khedivial mail boat and once in the
            Hedjaz will have to find a camel. Even if one
            camel is taken by two pilgrims there is no
            chance of getting one for less than LE 18 or
            20 even for the journey from Jeddah to Mecca
            and Arafat and thence to Yambo. Taking this
            cause as a test the 3rd class pilgrim will have
            to pay:-
            Deposit... ......................   P.T.	156
            Return ticket. .................... „	500
            Minimum half share in one camel.	„	900
            P.T. 1,586
            without counting the alms and bakhshish
            which he will be obliged to pay.</p>
            <p>If, on the other hand, he travels with the
            Mahmal he will only have to pay.
            Deposit...................... P.T.	156
            Transport and return.......... „	300
            Half share in a camel......... „	675
            Unforeseen expenses...	...	...	„	69
            P.T. 1,200</p>
            <p>But in reality this is only a deposit, and if
            the camel hire does not reach the fixed price
            and there are no unforeseen expenses the sur-
            plus will be returned to him.</p>
            <p>So far from profiting the Government, these
            measures are decidedly costly owing to the
            necessary arrangements with the Khedivial
            Mail S. S. Co. by the guarantee of a mini-
            mum number of pilgrims in return for the
            reduction of fares.</p>
            <p>This year, moreover, the Government has
            not hesitated to bring the escort of the
            Mahmal up to 400 men, this increase of 280
            men involving an additional expenditure of
            LE 5,000. In spite of this the obligatory depos-
            its are not be increased.</p>
            <p>Only the deposits of the lowest class cover
            all the expenses. As for the others, if the
            price of a camel is the same as last year
            the Government will pay the difference itself
            to convince the pilgrims of its anxiety for
            their comfort and welfare.</p></div>

            <div type="item"> <head>CAIRO FETE COMMITTEE</head>
            <head>LAST NIGHTS BALL</head>
            <p>The ball given at Shepheard's last night was
            a huge success, and reflected the greatest credit-
            on the organising powers of the Cairo Fete Com-
            mittee. Nearly all the leading members of Cairo
            society were present, also a large number of
            visitors, and the scene in the ball-room was a
            most brilliant one, especially during the cotillon,
            which began on the stroke of midnight and
            was led by Mme Cottaui and Mr. De Martino.</p>
            <p>We believe that this is the first occasion on
            which all the principal hotels have combined
            in organising a fete on such a large scale, and
            the success of the experiment is of good augury
            for the future.</p></div>

            <p>Lady Magheramorne, who is to marry Lord
            Cromer's nephew, Mr. Hugo Baring, has been
            a widow not quite two yean. She was the
            second of the five beautiful daughters of the
            eighth Earl of Shaftesbury, of whom the other
            four married the Earl of Mar and Kellie, Sir

            Mr. Levett. Lady Evelyn Ashley married the
            second Baron Magheramorne, Sir James Doa-
            glss McGarel-Hogg, in 1889, when she was
            twenty-four, and has one charming daughter
            who is now in her fifteenth year. Lady Maghe-
            ramorne, though well known and very popular
            in society, is still better known in county
            Antrim, for country life appeals very strongly
            to her.</p>

            Lord Revelstoke. He is twenty-eight, end was
            a lieutenant in the 4th Hussars. He served
            with some distinction in the Transvasl War,
            and still carries the scars of that campaign.</p>
            <p>The marriage of Miss Dorothy Wynn (sister
            of Lord Newborough) to Commander Cuthbert
            Chapman, is fixed for February 1 at the pictu-
            resque Chapel Royal, Savoy, where Lord and
            Lady Newborough themselves were married
            four years ago. After the wedding Commander
            Chapman and his bride will leave for Italy and
            Egypt.</p>
            <p>The rumour as to Saba Pasha’s retirement
            appears to have arisen in some mysterious
            way from Journalistic speculations as to
            Kaimakam Borton Bey's future post.</p>
            <p>The Sanitary Administration has authorised
            Mr. Augustus Newton to practice as a phar-
            macist in Egypt.</p></div>
