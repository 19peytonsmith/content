                   <p> FRANCE AND SYRIA.</p>
                   <p> During his recent visit to France H.B. Mgr.
                    Hawayek, the Maronite Patriarch, appears to
                    have accorded interviews to several French
                    journalists in which he stated that the
                    Maronite population of the Lebanon, whatever
                    its sympathies with other nations, could not
                    forget that it owed its present comparative
                    freedom and happiness to French intervention,
                    and had no idea of exchanging a French for a
                    German protectorate. Whether the Patriarch
                    would have spoken with the same fervour
                    during M. Combes' regime is doubtful That
                    vigorous anti-clerical did not realize that the
                    French protectorate over the Eastern Christians
                    was from every point of view a “valuable
                    asset,” and the studied incivility with which
                    the Patriarch himself was treated on one
                    occasion might have cost the Republic dear.
                    Fortunately for French interests, M. Combes'
                    successor has realised that anti-clericalism J is '
                    not an article for exportation, and his policy
                    has done much to heal tho sores left by his
                    predecessor’s rather unwise neglect. None the
                    less the position of France in Syria is by
                    no means so strong as in former years. The
                    Germans, though they have not extended their
                    operations to the Lebanon, are extending their
                    influence in Palestine to the Damascus region.
                    The Jewish colonies in the Holy Land are
                    more German than French in origin and
                    sympathies, and Russia, France's ally in
                    Europe, had made formidable progress until
                    her prestige was overthrown by Japan. Ameri-
                    can influence, though not directly political,
                    mast affect local politics. Education in Syria
                    is largely in American hands, and the Ameri-
                    can College at Beyrout is now a serious rival
                    of the Jesuit schools and colleges. British in-
                    fluence, always strong among the Druses and
                    Protestants of Syria, has gained fresh strength
                    since the young Syrians took to visiting Egypt
                    in search of an honest government and lucrative
                    employment, and our commercial interests in
                    Palestine and Syria are far superior to those
                    of any other nation. It is for France to decide
                    whether her influeuce in Syria shall survive or
                    not, and on her decision much depends, for, if
                    France gradually withdraws from the Near
                    East to concentrate her attention on her new
                    African Empire, there can be no doubt that her
                    great European rival will make every effort to
                    take her place. British statesmen hare long
                    looked forward complacently to a German
                    protectorate over Asia Minor, but the increase
                    of German influence in Syria might well be
                    regarded with suspicion by the Power most
                    interested in Egypt.   </p>

About 10 O'clock on Monday night, and unus-

A soldier, feeling unwell, plunged into the Nile,

Some bystanders at once gave the alarm and
several plucky attempts at rescue were made,
but the current was strong and the swimmers
had some difficulty in regaining the shore, one
of them, indeed, being landed in an exhausted

<p> "OLD MOORE and Egypt- We reproduce
the following prophecy taken from Old Moore's
Almanac a titre de curiosité:- "Old Moore has
selected a somewhat humorous picture for the 
month of August- that is to say, the smile is
on the side of John Ball. Not withstanding
the most enthusiastic mutual good feeling be-
tween France and Great Britian, the fact cannot
be overlooked that our friends across the 
Channel have seen with envy the marvelous
prosperity that the Government of Great
Britain has brought to Egypt, and we
may expect about now a movement on
the part of France to endeavor to check in
some way that money-making monopoly which
Mr. Bull holds in the land of the Pyramide."
The illustration referred to, which comes under
the heading of August, 1906, represents a 
group of money-laden natives entering an
English bank, and John Bull, seated on a
camel, being pulled back by the heels by three

<head> THE TRADE OF EGYPT </head>
<head> SEPTEMBER CUSTOMS RETURNS. </head>
<p>The imports for the past month (inclusive
of tobacco) totaled L.E. 1,975,946 against
L.E 1,742,088 during the corresponding
month of the previous year, showing an in-
crease of LE 233,858. For the first nine
months of 1905 the value of all imports
amounted to L.E. 14,716,859 against L.E.
13,573,380 in the period January 1-Septem-
her 30, 1904, an ncrease of L.E 603,912
last moth- a decided drop from the 
figures of September, 1904 when they
amounted to L.E 616,119. Owing no doubt,
to the causation of hostilities, imports from
China and the Far East show a 13% increase,
while Turkish imports have risen from L.E.
280,688 in September, 1904, to L.E. 327,939
last month, and Austria and Sweden show a
decided increase. For the nine-months period
British imports show an increase of L.E. 282,871,
French imports of L.E. 336,167, Turkey and
the USA have largely increased their im-
ports, and Sweden show an increase of 30%.
A decline is noted in German, Italian, and 
Swiss imports, and in those from India and the
Eastern possessions of the British Empire. </p>
	<p>Turning to exports, the total for the month
amounts to LE 928,302 a fall of L.E. 109,439
as compared to September, 1904. For the first
nine months of the present year the total
exports are valued at L.E. 12,878,173, against 
L.E. 13,724,419 in the corresponding period of
1904, showing a decline of L.E. 846,246. Ex-
ports to Great Britain fell off for the month and
for the first three quarters; the total dimina-
tion in value for the last-named period amount-
ing to L.E. 520,373. The exports to Italy con-
tine to show a falling-off in value, and the
only great increase to be noted is in the Amer-
I can trade, which shows export figures, this
September that more than double those of
September, 1904, and has given the remarkable
increase on the nine months period of L.E.
333,329. The decrease of exports to Russia is
very marked, while British Eastern possessions
have nearly doubled their import trade from
Egypt.</p> </div>

<head>CAIRO SHOOTING OLTRAGE </head>
<head>HEARING OF WITNESSES </head>
<p>Carmelo Pissani, a native of Malts, was
brought up again yesterday morning before
Mr. Alban, at the British Consular Court in
Cairo, charged with shooting with intent to 
murder Victoria Dehan and Austrian subject
who had been living with the accused for some
time at Port Said. </p>
<p>We related in our issue of Monday how
Pisani, when finding that the young woman
had left with another lover for Cairo, followed
them there, and on discovering their where-
a bouts had gone on Friday afternoon to the
house situated near Ataba-el-Khadra, and fired
at his victim on her refusing to return with
him to Port Said. He afterwards turned the
weapon on himself, and fired again, causing,
however, only a slight wound. </p>
<p>The first witness called was Gaetano Muns-
for who disposed as followed, "I am a printer by
trade. I saw prisoner on Friday for the first
time at about a quarter past three o'clock in
the afternoon. I was, then in the office of the 
'Imparzale'. I am the proprietor of the print-
ing establishment where the paper is printed.
Whilst there I heard a revolver shot and went
out to see what has happened. I saw the proprie-
tress of the lodging house opposite my pace at
a window and ward her shouting to me"Help
help, as they are killing upstairs." I replied
that could not risk my life with people who
were armed. I returned to my shop, when I
heard another shot. Then, at the request of
the land lady of the lodging house, I rant to
the end of the street and found a man belong-
ing to the fire brigade whom I aroused from
sleep. In the meanwhile I heard a third shot
at a short interval from the last. The fireman
went to the caracole to fetch a policeman whilst
I returned to my shop. Then, when entering
I saw a woman, who was wounded, coming out
of the lodging house and bleeding from the
right side. I saw the blood running down her
side. Behind the woman I saw the accused
also coming dow and covered with blood. He
has nothing on his hand. The man wanted to
lead back Victoria, but she pushed him away.
When he saw that the woman did not wish to
go with him Pieani returned to the house.
The wounded woman wanted to come into my
shop, but I refused her admittance."
On Mr. Alban here mentioning that he
thought this conduct inhuman the witness
explained that he did not want her to come
into the shop by the front and asked her to go
to the workshop at the back to prevent a
crown collecting, and anything disagreeable
occurring with the police. </p>
<p>The witness continued: "After a little while
some policemen arrived and commenced to
hold an enquiry. None of these policemen
dared to go in, but remained outside. In the
meanwhile the accused came down with his
hat on and a flu-whisk in his hand. Pirani
walked quietly away, the policeman following.
When the accused stopped and looked round
the two policemen courageously got out go
the way (great laughter). The crowd, on
seeing this kept calling out "Arrest the man,
he did the deed." They, however, kept at
a safe distance. The fireman called by me
afterwards took hold of the prisoner, seizing
him by both arms. He was then conducted
to the caracole. Later there arrived the chief
of the secret police, the mamour of the
district, and some other people, and Victoria
then returned to the house where she lived.
When the woman went back her second
lover, named Giorgio came, and on being
told that his signora was wounded he ran
upstairs. I got to know that his man on
seeing a revolver upstairs came down again
and ran away as fast as he could go. Shortly
after the wounded woman was brought down,
put into a carriage and driven away. After
about half an hour she returned to the
house with an Arab. I led her upstairs. On
my coming out I met the accused, who
had been brought back to the house, accom-
panned bu the police, I asked him whether
this woman was his wife or his sister. He
answered "No". I then asked him how those
wounds had been inflicted. He replied "I
don't know. I heard two shots but I don't
know where they came from." There was a
revolver lying on the table, and on being
asked by the mamour if it belonged to him
Pisani said it was not his. </p>
<p>In no answer to a question from his Honor,
the witness declared there was an interval of
about five minutes between each shot.
The second witness was Rosine Krauss, an
Austrian subject, who is the keeper of the
lodging-house. The woman deposed that
Victoria came with a man called Giorgio
Mascarelli about two months ago and the repre-
sensed themselves as husband and wife. On
the 11th the accused knocked at her door just
before noon. In reply to her enquiry Pisani
said he wanted to see a certain Victoria Dehan.
She told him she knew no person of that name.
He added that he had come from Port Said on
behalf of the consulate. The accused then left.
Witness afterwards went to Victoria's room and
told her what had happened. She looked out 
of the window, and on seeing her Pisani return-
ed to the house and again knocked at the door,
but Victoria begged witness not to open. Then
accused forced the door open and came in.
Subsequently he went out with Victoria. About
3.30 p.m. the latter returned with her supposed
husband. Last Friday afternoon the accused
called again and an altercation ensued, the
upshot of which was the he drew a revolver
and shot his ex-paramour, while she and her
mother (who had meantime put in an appear-
acne) were sitting on chair in the parlor.
After some more confirmatory evidence had
been heard, prisoner was remanded until 
Monday morning, when the remaining witnesses
will be examined. His Honor intimated that he
would consider the application for bail on
Saturday.  </p> </div>

<head> A SPORTING TRIP. </head>
<head>E.T.C. MEET AT SUBS</head>
<p>Last Friday, on the invitation of the Suez
E.T.C. Cricket Club and Mess, a team of
eleven representing the Alexandria staff of the 
same company left by the 3.40 p.m. train,
arriving at the Suez at 11.30 p.m. Although
cricket was the main object of the trip, tennis
(singles and doubles), a relay billiard math,
and a golf match were all fixed up before-
hand. On Saturday, at about 10.45, a start 
was made at cricket in very hot weather
(during the match the thermometer restored
95 degrees in the shade). R.B. McLean won the toss
and put in Suez in Maynard and Carpenter open-
ed against the bowling of Byrne and Thurston.
The wicket was not at its best and the
outfield very rough and slow, so that scoring
was a matter of some difficult. Byrne im-
mediately found his length and throughout
was almost unplayable, accounting for eight
of the wickets for thirteen runs (7 clean bowled)
-a most excellent bowling performance. The
remaining two Suez men were run out. More of
them should have suffered this fate had the
Alexandria throwing in been more accurate as
Suez ran some very risky runs. Maynard played
a very steady innings, as did Masey. Noe-
worthy livened things up a bit and showed how
to score in desert cricket by hitting "hard and
high", though fortunately for Alexandria not
"often". The total reached 72, - much better
one than it looked and quite equal to 180 on
the Alexandria ground. The lunch interval
was taken with the fall of the last Suez wicket,
and the game resumed at 2 o'clock. Stacey and
Cheeseman opened for Alexandria to the bowl-
ing of Mansell and Noseworthy, and the score
mounted steadily until, with the total at 15,
Stacey was bowled by Nosworthy. Cheesman
and Byrne put on 25 for the third wicket, and
after Cheesman left with a most useful 21 to
his credit, McLean's anxiety to score more
freely brought about his downfall. During
the partnership the winning hit was made.
Byrne did not long survive McLean, being
bowled by Battiscombe for a somewhat lucky
but invaluable 38. After his departure there
was a comparative collapse, the remaining five
wickets only producing 16 runs. G. McLean in
his nine had a brace of very big hits which
would have credited him with a dozen in Alex-
andria. The total reached 116. Score and
analysis:- </p>

proved the strongest and won by 6-3, 6-4. </p>
<p>At 8 o'clock a company of over forty, includ-
ing both teams, the staff of the cabeship
Duplex, and the other members of the Suez
mess, sat down to dinner in the speeded
dining-room of the staff mess and passed a
most pleasant hour and a half until speech
time. The toast list was made as short as
possible in order to allow of a start being made
in the billiard match. Harrison for "Alex."
started with Toms and, playing an uphill
game nearly all through, reached 100 to his
opponent's 96. G. McLean then took up the
one for Alexandria and Templeman for Suez.
This, too was very close and they were 180 all
when McLean put in a twenty break and gave
Byrne, who relieved him, this balance in hand.
Mansell, who was his opponent could not get
going, the balls running most unkindly, while
Byrne went steadily on, with the result that
Alexandria reached 300 to Suez's 237. R.B.
McLean, with Marx of Suez, then entered on
the final stage of the match, but Marx was
given too heavy a task, and Alexandria won
the match by 400 to 317. </p>
<p>Next morning the gold match was played,
and in this Suez scored their first success. Noe-
worthy beat Byrne by three and two, and 
Toms beat Harrison by three up. </p>
<p>Next morning the golf match was played,
and in this Suez scored their first success. Noe-
worthy beat Byrne by three and two, and
Toms bat Harrison by three up. </p>
<p>In the afternoon the remaining tennis match-
es came off, and Suez won two of the four.
Blythman beat Mansell 2 sets to 1. Byroe
lost to Quintana 1 set to 2. Blythman and
Byrne best Mansell and Mudge 2 sets to love.
Cheesman and Henley lost to H. R. Harris
and Menzies love to 2 sets. Alexandria there-
fore won by 7 sets to 3, 60 games to 31 and 3
matches to 2. This brought the series of match-
es to an end and the result was very satis-
factory to the visitors. The Alexandria men
were the guests of the Suez mess and were
treated right royally, enjoying their trip im-
mensely. Hopes were freely expressed of a
return fixture and of the mateb being an
annual one. The Railway Administration de-
serve mention for their very sporting assist-
acne in giving a considerable reduction in the
railway fare. Part of the Alexandria team
returned on Sunday and the rest on Monday. </p>

           <p> The "Times" contains the following
            article from correspondent Alexandria
            Anyone who has followed closely the laws
            enacted of late years in Egypt cannot fail often
            to notice in them a lack of business foresight.
            I am now dealing with one of the laws which
            never fails to raise grave complaints on all
            hands in Egypt and which since its birth has
            been the cause of great dissatisfaction. This 
            is the now famous law on the "Concordat Pre
            ventif." The measure appears to have taken
            its origin from the French law of Match 4,
            1839, on the "Liquidation Jadiciairt,” and
            imperfect as this law has been pronounced to
            be, the Egyptian law on the’ “conoordat Pre
            ventif” is very much worse. One market
            consequence of the law is that the number
            of failures had decreased and the number of
            admitted to the benefit of the "Conbordat
            Preventif” has been steadily on the increase. </p>
                    <p>THE LEGISLATURE AND BANKRUPTCY
                        To the Egyptian legislator it seemed that
                        the time had come to admit that in Egypt
                        there were merchants and traders who, through
                        misfortunes altogether independent of any
                        fault of theirs, had fallen into commercial
                        trouble. But the legislator apparently lost sight,
                        of the fact that half at least of these worthy ,
                        merchants would be natives whoso ways 
                        of trading and ideas of commercial order
                        were but little known to him. It was
                        not realised that the social opprobium from
                        which the “Concordat Preventif’ was intended
                        to save tho unfortunate and innocent traders’
                        was of no great moment to the native mer-
                        chant ; bankruptcy indeed has not the same
                        moral and social consequences, even to 
                        European in Egypt, that it has in Euro
                        pean countries. Thus the reason which led to
                        the enactment of the French law on the
                        '‘Liquidation Jud ciaire" did not seem to exist
                        in Egypt; and in fact what Egypt required
                        were more stringent and severe laws dealing
                        with failures and bankruptcies, and not a law
                        which has afforded a wider field than existed
                        before to unscrupulous merchants and their
                        creditors for fraudulent mareuvers to the
                        detriment of honest traders.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The French Liquidates Judiciaire.”</p>
                     <p>   M. Demole in his report to tho French
                        Senate on tho "Loi de la Liquidation Judi
                        ciaire" explained the object of the law when he
                        said:-</p>
                    <p>    This new regime, which is reserved for debt-
                        ors unfortunate and of good faith, and which
                        adjusts the law, as iar as convenient, for the
                        regulation of their business, would free those
                        debtors from the sharp humiliations and harsh
                        treatment which accompany the state of bank
                        ruptcy. This law would, in the interest of
                        creditors, simplify the preliminary operation
                        of settlement and arrive sooner and with les
                        expense either at the ‘conoordat' (composition)
                        or the liquidation of the assets. But [he con-
                        tinued], in order that a merchant could claim
                        the application of the benefit of the new law,
                        it is necessary that the Courts, called upon
                        always to judge the merchant's position, should
                        not find in the conduct of his business either
                        bad faith or any one of those serous faults
                        which prove on the part of him who committed
                        them wilful disregard of his own responsibilities
                        That is the object of proposing this law.
                        It most be borne in mind that this French
                        law was the result of much criticism adverse
                        to the law of May 28, 1838, which dealt
                        severely with all bankruptcy. A similar thing
                        cannot be said of the application of the former
                        Egyptian law on bankruptcy ; in fact, such as
                        it was, it was a good law, and all it required
                        was that criminal jurisdiction should be given
                        to the Mixed Courts over cases of fraudulent
                        and simple bankruptcies. These extended
                        powers of the Mixed Courts would have been
                        the means of impressing prospective bankruptcy
                        with the fear of a stricter and more effective
                        law than the old 'one, which deferred criminal
                        proceedings against the bankrupt to the Con
                        sular Court, with the result that scarcely ever
                        if at all, was the matter extended beyond 
                        mere complaint made to the Consular autho
                        rity.</p>
                    
                   <p> WORKING OF THE "CONCORDAT PREVENTI</p>
                 <p>   It has been contended that the law on the
                    "Concordat Preventif' is a good law. I have
                    already said that in practice it is most un
                    satisfactory, as it is also in its conception, and
                    if that contention were justified, then this law
                    either is not strictly applied by the Courts
                    whose business it is to apply it, or else it con-
                    tains something which diverts its aim. I am
                    afraid that both those things are responsible
                    for the dissatisfaction felt with the law. The
                    operation of tbs law is as follows : — The
                    would be commercial malheureux et de bonne
                    Joi files a declaration of insolvency in
                    the registry Of the Court accompanied
                    by his balance sheet; he may or he may
                    not deposit his books; very seldom he
                    does. At the first sitting of the Court after
                    the filing of the declaration, the matter is
                    brought forward; no notice is given to the
                    creditors and the Court begins by delivering
                    a judgment admitting the declarant to the
                    benefit of the “Concordat Preventif’-under
                    the circumstances, of course, with out a dis-
                    sentient voice. Once proclaimed a malheureux
                    et de bonne foi Article 206 enacts that the
                    Court shall appoint one of the judges, “who
                    will sign the books of the debut and who
                    will proceed to verify the situation ....
                    and will convene a meeting of the creditors
                    before him with a view to learning their opi
                    nion on the admission to this Concordat Pre-
                    ventir and will read to the meeting a report
                    on the good faith of the debtor, his buisness
                    position, and his proposals for a composition.
                    The Judge, of course, appoints an expert of the
                    Court to overband the books and examine all
                    papers, and it is he who makes out the report.
                    If the debtor succeeds in obtaining a majority
                    representing three-fourths of his crediitors
                    claims he is entitle to the concordat ; but
                    This concordat” must be homologated-or
                    confirmed by the Court. Here the creditor! it

                    rupt moreover, the “concordat” remains subject
                    to the provision of Article 1341 and 312 of the
                    Commercial Cole in case of fraud as therein
                    mentioned or of non fulfilment of the condition

                  <p>  DEFECTS IN PRACTICE</p>
                   <p> No doubt to the uninitiated these legal pre
                    cautions may appear a sufficient guarantee ;
                    unfortunately they are ineffective,for it is found
                    in practice that the law has put the cart before
                    to the horse. Indeed, what the law asks is that the
                    debtor be declared malheurenx el de bonne
                    foi on his own affirmation, and that is con-
                    sidered sufficient to begin with. Then his
                    itaation is investigated, and when this is
                    done the creditors are asked to come and
                    prove that the debtor is not maUteureux el
                    de bonne foi. It would seem for all logical
                    purposes that the reverse should happen. It
                    would be more rational if the Court were,
                    on the declaration made by the debtor, to
                    appoint at once an expert who would report
                    to the Court on the situation and circum-
                    stances of the insolvency, give notice of the
                    deposit of the report and the books and all
                    papers at the registry to tho creditors, and
                    then fix a day for the creditors to appear
                    in Court and put forward their observations.
                    The full Court would then give their judg-
                    ment with complete knowledge of the case.
                    As now happens the fall Court hears the
                    minority of the creditors after the majority
                    has already confirmed-by its vote the provi-
                    ional admission of the debtor to the benefit
                    w of the ““Concordat Preventil,” which is a
                    totally different thing. The Judge appointed
                    by the Court leaves everything in the hands
                    of the expert, who in practice not being invest-
                    ed, as in the case of a bankruptcy, with
                    the power of a syndic, must often simply
                    give an account of the position, seldom trou-
                    bling himself except in patent cases with
                    giving an opinion as to tho good faith of the
                    debtor. On the other hand, there being no
                    supervision whatever over the creditors—by_a
                    committee of creditors — the- -greatest abuses
                    are most frequently committed ; personal ad-
                    li vantages are distributed by the debtor, and
                    when, on paper, it appears to the Court that
                    the debtor offers, say. 40 per cent.) one or more
                    creditors have actually received an extra 10
                    per cent or more, according to their importance
                    and their ingenuity in extorting all they can
                    out of their unscrupulous debtor. The majority
                    required by the law is thus obtained; the
                    Court’s practice almost invariably follows the
                    of vote; and Article 210 is and remains a dead
                    letter for an upright creditor unless he can
                    make tho Court acquire the conviction that
                    the debtor is not “anfortunate and of good
                    faith.” But in order to do so he must bring
                    nothing short of palpable proof of fraudulent
                    bankruptcy, and that is not an easy matter.
                    Many circumstances may concur to show the
                    absence of good faith on the part of the debtor,
                    which will, however, fall short of fraudulent
                    bankruptcy; yet, although the |aw does— not
                    require as much, the Courcs satisfy themselves,
                    nevertheless, with a majority of votes, unless,
                    as Isay, there can be made out a crashing
                    in case against the debtor</p>
                    
                   <p> PlAYING WITH THE LAW.</p>
                 <p>   The result of all this is that the law has
                    become a most convenient means whereby a
                    man may enrich himself. And naturally so,
                    for on the one hand the expert is a mere
                    inoffensive instrument; and as he has no power
                    worth mentioning, he counts for very little
                    indeed, and in practice he confices himself
                    strictly to his ludicrous mission. On the other
                    hand the creditors are easy prey; and the
                    debtor can do anything he likes with them;
                    the obstreperous minority is not to be feared,
                    for the Court follows the majority. Moreo ve
                    there is, it seems, no appeal against the judg-
                    ment confirming or homologating the decision
                    of the majority of the creditors. What could be
                    better for the debtor And let us bear in
                    mind that the object of the law is to save the
                    trader the moral pain and social opprobrium
                    following upon a declaration in bankruptcy,
                    and also save the creditors expense by amelior-
                    atiag tho proceedings and simplifying the
                    legal process! The debtor has turned all this
                    to his advantage, and it has often been seen
                    that on the following day after his "concordat”
                    has been ratified he opens a larger shop, better
                    equipped, and supported by the credit of bis
                    former creditors. And why so I Because in most
                    cases his creditors are the agents of European
                    firms, to whom their representatives in
                    Egypt give the 40 per csnt. or mere 15 per
                    cant, appearing on paper for the “conoordat,"
                    while they pocket quietly the extra 5 per
                    cent, 10 per cent., or 20 cent. according to
                    circumstances, and in consideration of which
                    they have recommended to their firms in
                    Europe the acceptance of the “conoordat” and
                    the continuance of supplies of goods when the
                    debtor is whitewashed by the majority of his
                    creditors.</p>
                  <p>  It has, indeed, been asserted that the Frenoh
                    law on the "Liquidation Judicair” is no
                    better. This is wrong; that law is bad, but
                    it is better than the one in Egypt. Article 4
                    of the French law enacts that the full Court,
                    in Chambers, shall summon before it the
                    debtor and examine him, which is something
                    akin to our examination in England by the
                    registrar and the official reciever. The debtor
                    has to explain his position to the Court before
                    it provisionally pronounces its opinion. The
                    report on the law to the French Senate set forth
                    plainly :—"We thought it was not sufficient
                    to make the appearance of the debtor before
                    the full Court optional; in chambers we made
                    it compulsory." Moreover, Article 9 of the
                    law enacts that the Judge shall ask the cre-
                    ditor whether they will appoint a few amongst
                    them to control the work of the liquidator
                    There is no such provision in the Egyptian
                    law.</p>

           <head>    MISSIONS IN THE SUDAN. 	</head>
            <p>    A PIONEER EXPEDITION. </p>
                
              <p>  Reuter’s Agency is informed that an im-
                portant missionary pioneer expedition to the 
                Sudan is being depatched by the Church
                Missionary Society this month. The sphere of
                work has been selected by the Earl of Cromer,
                and comprises a region about four times the
                size of England, inhabited by pagan tribes, the
                majority of whom are men of immense stature, 
                and some of whom are cannibals. Roughly 
                speaking, it will start from the junction of the 
                Sobat and Bahr-el-Ghazal rivers, and stretch-
                ing on both sides of the Nile will extend to the
                northern border of Uganda and the north-
                east comer of the Congo Free State. Running 
                along the northern part of Lake Rudolph, it 
                will include the south-western boundary of 
                Abyssinia. The region is largely one of sudd
                and swamp, being intersected by the Upper 
                Nile, which will form tho principal route of
                communication.	</p>
           <p>     It is only now, when, in the opinion of Lord
                Cromer and the Sirdar,the political and general 	
                situation warrants it, that it is found possible 
                to reply to an appeal for a mission in this 
                region which was made by General Gordon
                nearly thirty years ago. The mission will link
                up Egypt aid Uganda.	
                The first party,' consisting of six mission
                aries, will leave Marseilles on the 18th inst by 
                the German steamer Schleswig, and hope to 
                reach the scene of their labours by Christmas. 
                They take provisions for twelve months, and 
                expect to live for a considerable period in
                boats and tents. At Cairo, after conferring 
                with Lord Cromer, they will proceed to Khar
                toum, whence they will travel by sailing boats, 
                which will be acquired by tho mission, for 
                about 1,100 miles np the White Nile. Escorted 
                by Arch lesson Gwyone of Khartoum, they 
                will first go right through the new district to 
                its most southerly point at Mongalla, a 
                Government' station, near the borders of the
                headquarters of the mission will be fixed near 
                This point the only other habitable place being 
                Bir situatedon the line some distance to the
                north of Lido. Tho Pagan tribes inhabiting 
                this region include the Nuers, Dinks, Shilluks,
                Baris, and Niam Niams. The whole of the 
                vast areahassuffered considerably from Dervish
                raids, but the natives are now regaining confi
                dence.	</p>
              <p>  An addition to the clergy who go with the 
                pioneers, the party includes a doctor from 
                Poplar Infirmary, a carpenter from one of the 
                County Council technical schools, and an an
                agricultural expert. After escorting them
                to Mongalla, where they will be met by Dr. da
                A. R. Cook, of the Uganda yission, who still
                have medical supervision, for six months, 
                Arohdeacon Gwayne will return to his work at 
                Khartoum. It is is tended at first to commence 
                industrial work among the pagans, and in time 
                teach them to manufacture bricks. It is
                hoped that a second party will be despatched 1
                from England in July, and a third next autumn. 
                Tho region indicated by Lord Cromer was
                specially selected, so that the work in view du
                would not touch tho Mohamedan population,
                and would not clash with the spheres occupied
                by the Americans on the Sobat, and by the
                Austrian Roman Catholic Mission. In in-
                dicating the new sphere to the Church 
                Missionary Society, Lord Cromer says: “It
                is bounded, on the north by the Bahr-
                ar el Ghazal, on the east by a line proceeding 
                south from the White Nile, starting at a point
                about half-way between where the Nile is 
                joined by the Bahr-el Zaraf, and where it is 
                joined by the Gahr el-Jebel to Ajiung, and
                thence southwards to Twi. From Twi the line 
                proceeds due east to the Abyssinian frontier
                and thence follows the frontier to the Uganda 
                border on tho fifth parallel of North Latitude. 
                On the south it is bounded by the northern do
                border Qf the Congo Free State, the Lado en- 
                clave, and the Uganda province; on the west,
                by a line drawn from Marhre-el-Rek to a point 
                where the frontiers of the Congo Free State,
                the French’Grugftand the Bahr el Ghazal meet
                near N'Darama.</p>

               <p>“Times."</p>
                <p>The public are confident that the Agree
                ment will prove a bulwark of the peace 
                Asia for many years to come. .... We may
                admit at once that treaties made on eqna
                terms between one Great Power and anothe;
                have their disadvantages as well as theii
                advantages, like most other human arrange
                ments. Bet the prejudice whicn condemn.-
                treaties in principle upon this ground is in
                dotd old-fashioned. It depends on a conception
                of foreign politics which never was altogethei
                correct, and which the modem developments ol
                WiUpolitik have rendered quite out of date.
                ......All the Great Powers now have in-
                terests and aspirations in parts of Asia
                elsewhere where our interests are Vital. All
                of them believe in alliances and are actually
                in aihancos, or ready to enter into alliances,
                for various objects. Isolation in these condi-
                tions spells weakness, mid weakness, in the
                case of a Power so wealthy as ourselves, is an
                invitation to aggression, the only method ol
                preserving the peace of Asia is to confront
                any ambitions directed against it by the ready
                arms of a coalition too strong to be defied.
                Our Treaty with Japan Las established soob i
                coalition, and has mado peace secure in the

              <p>  There is only one moral to bo derived from
                tho acrimonious controversy arising out of the
                revelations of oertain ol our Paris contempora-
                ries, and that is that diplomatists should only
                talk to one anotber.When the Foreign Ministei
                of one country unbosoms himself to tfewspapei
                correspondents of another on matters of imme
                diate or recent negotiations, recriminations are
                certain to follow. Lately thero has been a
                riotous outburst of confidences of this perilous
                nature ; Priuoe Buelow, Count Witte, and the
                inspirer of the articles in the "Matin" have
                talked openly upon subjects that should only
                ba diacussd in the strictest privacy . . . .
                We regret that Prinoo Buelow should bavi
                given provocation, and that M. Delcaasd —if hi
                has really inspired the "revelations"—should
                have taken up the challenge. Who profits by
                these disclosure* 1 If they are not based upor
                fact, no words can be too strong to condemi
                their fabrication. If they are substantially true
                the whole story is known already to thosi
                principally concerned, who have oome to at
                arrangement which it is nobody's interest 
                disturb.</p>

               <p> It has always been the wish of the Boglisl
                Government and people to live on good termi
                with Germany. We are oonacioue of no enmity
                towards the Fatherland, and our only rivalry
                lies in the honorable field of commercial com-
                petition. Nor shall we allow our polioy to b«
                altered, our judgment disturbed, or even oui
                temper ruffled by the angry and ill-informed
                comments of oertain German pubdeists on the
                reoent action of Great Britain in regard to
                French rights in Morooco. We regret to ob-
                serve, however, that a hectoring tone has been
                taken up by journals which have hitherto ob
                served a judicious moderation in their attitude
                toaarda ourselves. It is not difficult to account
                for the irritation which they display. They art
                uncomfortably consoious that the national
                diplomacy bas met with a sudden and very
                nuplcasant check....................
                Every State fir itself—that is the Gerrman
                motto,and the sufficient answer is,“Forewarned
                forearmed." Nevertheless the conspicuous fail
                of Berlin, in this instance as in others
                proceeds from its insensibility to the feelirgi
                of nstions. Individually, the German is by nr
                means harsh or selfish, bat the action of bii
                Government is deplorably lacking /in regari
                for tbe finer feelings of humanity.</p>

                revelations. It loves, like onr own ';Matio,
                to make onr flesh creep, and in the

                <p>There are, of course, moments in French
                diplomacy when the idea of an Anglo German
                rapprochement it inconvenient to France but
                for permanent purposes France cannot pat
                herself into the hands of any partner who is
                not, in the case of a quarrel, exposed
                To the same liability as herself, the
                liability of invasion. This is bound to be the
                Case for quite obvious and elementary reasons,
                though some of anti-Germans seem to
                have great difficulty in understanding it.</p>

                <p>No useful purpose can concavely be
                Served by taking up the challenge of the Ger-
                man Press to indulge in mutual recrinations
                or on paper. It is easy to understand that the
                German nation and the German Government
                are in a state of high tension and suffering 
                from a bad attack of "nerves." That was 
                already the oase beforo the alleged revelations 
                of the "Matin" found their way to print. And 
                now the official communique which graces the
                German Press does its best to make the trouble 
                worse. Its language is pompous, and therefore 
                absurd. To reply to it in kind would a be
                loss of dignity and common sense. But the 
                whole incident shows how "blazing" are the 
                at indiscretions of to-day. How sober and re- 
                sponsible Ministers such as Prince von Buelow 
                (The fount and origin of the trouble) and
                M. Delcaise (the supposed inspirer of the
                ^ "Matin") can venture to play with fire as they
                have been doing, and continue to do, passes

              <p>  An Anglo French alliance, destined, whether
                30 desired or not, to arouse keen anxiety in Ger-
                many, would be a source of great strength for
                England. It would not, however, be a source
                er of strength for France. British friendship is
                precious to us, and we wish to preserve it. The
                rapprochement it useful to us and we intend
                to safeguard it. An alliance, on the other
                hand, would be a cause of disturbance in
                Europe which, while compromising us, would
                in case of a conflict famish as with no sufficient
                guarantee. Our natural position and our per-
                manent interest is to be the allies of Rossia
                and the friends of England and Italy. . . If
                conflicts, which we do not consider inevitable
                and which we shall contribute to avert in the
                higher interest of civilisation, should unfor-
                tinnately break on, our army and navy should
                have no other mission in a difference occurring
                in which we had no concern than to safeguard
                is, the independence of one soil and of oar policy.
                se Apart from the Russian alliance, French policy
                in is and ought to remain one of courteous
                to autonomy.</p>

               <p> If the account published by the "Matin”
                were tree, it would represent nothing elethan
                n* a terrible exposure of M. Delcasse’s policy,
                which could, according to this account, have
                had no other object than a conflict between
                Germany and France We are not inclined to
                believe that England, without any out ward
                cause, came to the support of M. Delcasse with
                an offer of military assistance. Assuming the
                truth of the story, it is much more probable
                that M Delcaasl, when he found himself in a
                Could de sac with his Morocco policy, saw no way
                except war, and that be applied to Eng-
                land for military support This would con-
                clusively prove that M. Dekassl had brought
                France to the edge of war, and that the pro-
                Action of his policy would very probably have
                al ended in war—a war which we are convinced
                the vast majority of the French people as

             <p>   Are the “Matin’s" revelations true or on-

                as explanation of the rumours circulated some
                Time ago that the German navy was preparing
                for war against England. If the revelations
                bo based on truth, the re-organisation of the

                in quite a different light from that in which
                they have bitterroot been regarded. It would be

                who has hostile designs against Germany. Why,

           <p> "From Canea I pushed on direct for the 
            chief camp of the insurgent host at Therisso. 
            It is a poor mountain village, though rich for 
            the Cretans in historical associations. Its scat 
            Tired cottages are uuite unlike the packed 
            villages of Eeast and Central Crete, rising roof 
            above roof in terraces. Therisso live in a hollow 
            nearly 1,900 ft. above the sea, and is approached
            by one pass through an olive grove. From 
            the bills above can be described the capital, 
            Canea, with the foreign battleships lying at 
            anchor. No sentinels were posted as I and my 
            servant rode op announced, but groups of
            armed men stopped to stare at' us. About a
            score, rifles in hand, were seated at the Kaffen-
            cion, and finally we were brought up by five 
            burly fellows, including, I believe, the captain- 
            general of the forces, who inquired whence I 
            came and whither I went I made my way to a
            the Megan, a wooden shanty, where the pro- 
            printer, girded with cartridge belt and pistol, 
            his gun on the wall handy, was doing, a roar- 
            Ing trade in bread and cheese, boiled gherkins, 
            fried potatoes, lemons, wine, ‘mastics,’ and the 
            occasional luxury of a bit of meat oat from the 
            car case banging at the door. It was a curious 
            sight at evening, the groups of leaders—lawyers
            and doctors—in rough dress, -eating their 
            simple fare seated at tables, improvised from 
            planks and boxes, under the olive trees from 
            which swung an oil lamp or two; and ever and 
            anon numbers of the rank and file in their 
            Cretan costume of .'.braided waistcoat, baggy
            breeches, each and top boots, moved to and 
            fro with an occasional thud of the rifle butt, 
            for none would let hie gun out of his hands. 
            These included severe gendarmes, of whom 
            | about sixty had gone over to the revolutionists, 
            1 During the day the leaders wore occupied in the
            discussions, occasional harangues, and the
            arrangement of the movement of the bands.
            The men themselves, who renewed sixpence
            Per day pay were mostly engaged in playing
            cards. backgammon or sitting chatting outside
            the Kaffection. Owing to tho kindness of one 
            of the leaders, M. Manos, who I discovered 
            was a graduate of Balliol, I was able to make
            craniometrical observations on most of
            assembled warriort.”</p>

          <head>  ATTACKED BY BRIGANDS</head>
            <p>“From Theridio I continued my journey to-
            wards Shakia, that province which 
            stood more or less successfully conquerors
            of Crete, and the home of political revolutions. 
            I had been warned of the difficulties of the
            route itself, and was mors impressed by the
            drop of 3,100 ft. from the plain of Omalos 
            (4,000ft.) to the torrent bed below, than by 
            anything similar in the Himalayas or the billy
            regions of Ceylon. My servant and I were with 
            difficulty getting the mules down this precipit-
            ion side of the great gorge when we Were am-
            bushed by two armed men, wild shepherd folk 
            from the mountains. I was absolutely unarmed
            and rather taken aback when my servant called
            to me in Creek : 'They are going to fire, sir,
            and, looking up, beheld two mu ales pointed 
            at me at a distance of about a down yards. It
            was money they wanted ; a hundred napoleons
            (£80) they demanded; but as I was not inclin-
            ed to negotiate and it was impossible to escape,
            I adopted the obvious alternative and continu-
            ed the difficult dat cant It was slow work, and
            after a few yards calls, followed by stones and
            then ballets, were sent after me. The first four
            shots were wide and three times the men dam-
            be red down to get nearer aim, and with better 
            effect, for the last six fractured rocks at my 
            elbow, and the splinters brushed my forehead. 
            Thair sh ieling was oertainly bad, bnt then in 
            none of the encounters with the International
            troops have the insurgents displayed their 
            boasted gtod marksmanship. My servant had 
            been swearing in Greek daring this time that 
            we had no money, and with some effect, for 
            my ssiailants now demanded the mules and 
            the baggage. Finally after sundry disputes and 
            renewals of our journey they brought their
            demands down with Oriental suddenness to
            From which I met with an offer of 10fr. Unfor-
            tunately my servant, who was ahead, was made 
            to discharge his purse, the other robber mean
            while covering me with his rifle at six yards 
            and daring me to move. Ultimately we got rid
            of them, and two and a half hours of rocky 
            descent and fordings of the torrent brought us 
            to the poor little hamlet of Samaria."	</p>

           <head> ATTITUDE OF THE POWERS.</head>
           <p> "On tho general condition of the country 
            the state of political suspense has had most 
            unfortunate results. Capital is shy, industry 
            has suffered, and life and property are unsafe, 
            After the Powers had categorically refused, on to
            May 13, the request of the Chamber for union in
            with Greece, the insurgents adopted a more
            energetic propaganda, and the seizure of the 
            town of Vamos was followed in July by the
            capture of local customs houses. Encounters 
            bad so far been mainly convinced fined to Venezelo’s
            followers and the gendarmes and foreign
            troops. Now they are taking place between
            civilians, those — the great majority—who
            favor union and those whose interest it la
            to keep in with the present Government. This
            is a very serious development. At first the
            Powers treated the insurrection as a mere
            outbreak of a dissatisfied party and failed to
            Attach importance to the history of the last
            New year. During this period education, lan-
            guage, commerce, and general  communications 
            have been so many links in tho chain binding
            Crete to Greece, and instead of dealing with a
            Few armed bands led by burgry politician, the
            Protecting Powers find themselves face to face
            With a strong national majority whoM latent
            power will be sufficient to prolong the struggle.
            At the outset I was loth to contemplate Crete
            joining Greece, the material disadvantages to
            the former were obvious. 'Why no, said I to
            many a village politician, 'gradually develop a
            real autonomy but after journeying all over
            the island and meeting all classes of people, I
            from shepherds to Dr. Sphakianakis himself, 
            am convinced that outside the Mussulmans
            nine-tenths of the Cretans favor anion with
            Greece, and that the material disadvantages
            do not weigh with the racial feeling. Perhaps
            only the educated realise the former, bat they
            are quite prepared to face them. There is
            another reason, practical rather than senti-
            mental, which I do not find mentioned, bat
            which continually came op in quiet talks with
            villagers—that it the fear of annexation by
            one of the  crest Powers. Soda Bay is a tempt-
            ing harbour, and if yon refer to the solemn
            declaration of the Protecting Powers on this
            point, the Cretan quietly and tersely comments</p>

            <div type="item">
           <head> 'Egypt and Manchuria.’</head>
            <p>The protecting Powers are faced with an
            increasingly awkward situation caused by
            Prince George's failures in a very difficult
            position, their own procrastination, and the
            political rivalry among the Cretans. As known
            to me there were in July last only two bases—
            and these were considerable compromises—on
            which the insurgents would treat One was
            the impossible coup d/tat of Prince George
            going over to their camp, and the other the
            appointment of an experienced Greek admi-
            nistrator in place of Prince George, who could
            be trusted not to violate the censtitation.
            This, on the understanding that anion should
            ultimately take place. This is as far as the
            Cretan insurgents would go, but the difficulties
            in the way of acceptanoe by the Powers have
            relation to Prince George and his connection
            to the crowned beads of Europe. The Athenian
            papers which clamper for union would regard
            Prince George’s return as a disgrace, which
            would refleet in a u-nature upon the Greek
            Royal Family. Moreover, Prince George was
            the nominee of the Emperor of Russia and the
            companion of his travel in the Far Bast Here,
            then, is a deadlock out of which who shall
            deliver the Cretans"</p>

                <head>THE TSETSE FLY.</head>
                <p>Since the days of Dr. Livingstone, the tsetse
                fly has been known as constituting one of the
                greatest difficulties of African travel in many
                regions. It renders thousands of square miles
                of ’hat country uninhabitable, and (says the
                “Globe") neither horses, cattle, nor dogs can
                venture into the ‘ fly country.”Formerly it was
                thought that the fly injected poison into the
                animals, and so killed them. It is now known, 
                however, that the diseare is due to a minute
                blood parasite, a tscrewshaped organism
                known as trypanosoma, and that the fly only
                acts as a carrier. There parasites swim freely
                in the blood, and often number several mil-
                lions in every drop. It is a very remarkable
                fact that among the many blood sucking flies.
                which exist in Africa, the tsetse (Glossina
                monitans) is the only one capable of convey-
                ing the parasite from a diseased to a healthy
                animal. And the explanation of this is that
                the parasite has the power of multiplying in
                the body of this, and probably not is
                other flies. The former, at any rate, has been
                demonstrated recently by Messrs. Gray and
                Tulloch, two Army medical officers, who have
                been studying “sleeping sickness” in Uganda.
                Another curious fact is that tsetse flies
                brought directly from the "fly country,” where
                there is do disease, and allowed to bite healthy,
                cattle, at once produce the disease. This has
                led to investigations, which have shown that
                most of the wild animals of the country, buf-
                falo, koodoo, carry small numbers of try-
                panosomas in their blood. These organisms,
                which multiply to such an enormous extent in
                the blood of domestic animals, and produce
                such disastrous effects, can live in small num-
                bers in the blood of wild animals without any
                ill result. In a similar way, the trypanosome
                discovered by Surgeon-Major Lewis in India
                in the blood of healthy rats, nausea a fatal,
                disease in horses and dogs. This accounts for
                the fact that the test fly disease disappears 
                from a district as soon as the wild	
                killed iff, or driven away. At present, then, 
                the extermination of the wild game seems to
                be the only practical method for exterminating
                the disease.</p>
             <p>   That dread disease of the human subject, 
                the “sleeping sickness," is similar in its origin
                to the tsetse fly decrease of cattle. It is caused
                that is to say, by a species of trypanosome in
                the blood, aid conveyed from one subject to
                another by a specie) of tsetse-fly, "Glossina
                palpalis." And as the parasite of the cattle
                disease exists in small number in the blood of
                healthy wild animals, so this latter,trypanesa-
                probably occurs in some other species in a
                similar way. The discovery of this natural
                reservoir of the parasite would be a step
                towards the extermination of the dread "sleep-
                ing sickness."</p>

           <head> MACEDONIAN BRIGANDAGE.</head>
            <p>THE BRITISH CAPTIVE.</p>
            
          <p>  Some information regarding Mr. Philip
            Wills, the English gentleman whose fate it
            for the moment  matter of grave concern to
            the British Consular. officials in Macedonia,
            has been received by Reuter's Agency. Hr.
            Graves, the Consul General at Salonika, left
            on the 6th inst. for Moaastii; end it is believed
            that his journey were prompted by the receipt
            of a cut-off ear together with a letter affirming
            that it had been severed from the bead of Mr.
            Wills, who was detained prisoner by brigands,
            and for whose release a ransom of £6.000 must
            be paid before the 14th last. Mr. Wills was
            captured by bandits in the district of Monastir
            about the middle of July while ont shooting.
            About a fortnight later a body was found near
            Ochrida, and it was declared that it was that
            of Mr. Wills. A week later Hilmi Pasha, the
            Turkish Inspector General in Macedonia, gave
            notice that the report of his death was an tree,
            and that lit. Will* bed Joined a Greek bend.
            It was not until the beginning of September
            that the troth leaked oat. Definite information
            was then received that Mr. WiHr was alive
            bat was the prisoner of the tend of brigands.
            Mr. Wills is about 37 years of age. He is the
            eon of an engineer who was for many years
            engaged in work In Turkey, and is the brother
            of the British Consoler Agent at Ismid Al-
            ways of an adventurous disposition, he volun-
            teered for service with the British Army in the
            South African War. While in South Africa
            however, he was thrown from his horse, and
            being invalided home, returned to Turkey,
            where, through the influence of relatives, be
            obtained an appointment with the Turkish
            Tobaccor Regia.</p>
            
           <p> It is thought highly probable that the ear
            which has been sent to the British Consulate at
            Salonika is not really that of Mr. Wills, but
            has been sent with the idea of bringing pres-
            sure to tear in order the better to ensure the
            payment of the ransom demanded. Those who
            are acquainted with affairs in Macedonia do
            not think that the sum named (£6,000)is
            greater than the brigade are likely to claim
            as on previous occasions soma no less con-
            s id stable have been demanded as the ransom
            for the captives of bandits.</p>
