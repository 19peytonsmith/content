              <div type="item"><head>THE REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA.</head><p>The situation in Russia does not show any improvement. On every side there is chaos, and every day the condition of Russia goees from worse to worse, and the startling evidences of organisation that are provided by the wholesale extent of the area of revolt are driving many observers to "hail the dawn" for Russia as Fox did for France. The revolutionary movement has been compared to that which took place in France after the assemblage of the States-General: and the parallel is a striking, and in many respects a just one. But if the Russians, as has been remarked, have greater difficulties to face before they can achieve freedom, since they have not even the tradition of it, and no feeling of national unity such as animated France, there is one point on which they possess an enormous advantage. Throughout the French Revolution the Roman Catholic Church was practically a negligible quantity: if it attracted attention, it was only because it inspired the passionate hate of the Mountain, and the ridicule of the Sansculottes. But the Church in Russia has played a part that it has never attempted in Western Europe. Since the Empire was established a thousand years ago, it has been in the van of every national movement. It has blessed the expeditions against the Tartars and the Turks; it has endeavored to be the protector of all the Oriental Christians; it has sympathised with the peasant in his distress, and at times it has formulated the Imperial policy. But last January it was a priest of the Church who led the workmen at St. Petersburg: and it is significant in the highest degree that the clergy seem now to have abandoned the Government. If they, whose influence is naturally exerted in favor of the Autocracy, turn against it, what can be expected of that vast mass of people who are wavering in their allegiance, and what excesses may not be anticipated from those who have already decided on Revvolution as the one thing needful to save their country? The fate of Russia lies in her own hands. Whether a measure of popular control is to bbe the ultimate rule for the Muscovite Empire rests with the people. The sole result visible at present iis complete stagnation of commerce, and absolute chaos everywhere. Until her internal affairs are decided, Russia will hardly count among the Councils of the Great Powers: and the situation, unfortunately, reacts on the rest of Europe disastrously, not only so far as business is concerned, but in graver fashion as giving dangerous opportunities for ambition elsewhere.  </p></div>

                <div type="item"> <head>SALT AND SODA.
                QUESTION OF THE CONCESSION. EXCITEMENT ON BOURSES.</head>
                <p>The great excitement which was display¬ed on the Alexandria and Cairo Bourses yesterday, in the rash to dispose of Salt and Soda shares, was renewed this morning, when a further fall took place and lens of thousands of shares were disposed of. At midday some strong buyers appeared on the market and a slight recovery took place. The shares closed when we went to press at 24s. 6d.</p>
               <p>It is stated that the Egyptian Government has withdrawn the salt concession, but that there are grounds for believing that an arrangement will be arrived at between the company and the Government, so that a modus vivendi may be established. This news is, however, not official, but merely the substance of what is alleged on the Alexandria Bourse.</p>
                <p>Lord Cromer’s remarks on the subject in his last Report are worthy of quotation at the present juncture. His lordship says "I regard this (the salt monopoly) as one of the greatest of the remaining blots on the existing fiscal system. A country lest adapted for a monopoly of salt than Upper Egypt can hardly be imagined. The desert is full of salt, which can be had for the trouble of taking it away. In the long narrow strip of inhabited land, there are but few villages which are far from some salt deposit Smuggling, of course, takes place and it is practically impossible to stop it. In 1904, 1,716 cases of contraband occurred; the number of persons fined or imprisoned was 1,223. In the remaining cases, the salt was seized, and the animals used in smuggling were confiscated. The number of animals thus confiscated was 489. The offenders rarely, if ever pay the fines imposed, and, I conceive, do not much mind being imprisoned for a short t mo. Confiscation of the animals is probably a more severe punishment, as it must often reduce the culprits, who are all very poor, to a state of indigence. Although no domiciliary visits are ever made to search for salt, it cannot be doubted that the measures taken to repress the contraband trade axe rightly regarded by the population as oppressive. I hope, therefore, that the financial situation will, at tome future time, permit of a Urge reduction in the royalty now paid on salt A small reduction would merely involve a loss of revenue, and would not lead to any considerable increase of consumption.”</p>
                <p>The revenue derived from the salt monopoly in 1904 was L.E. 182,000 as compared to L.E. 169,000 in 1903 ; 60,000 tons of salt were consumed. This is at about the rate of 5.4 kilos, per head of population. The normal consumption in most European countries is considerably higher than this figure.</p>
                <p>Prior to 1892, all salt was sold direct by the Government at a price of P.T. 800 a ton. It is now sold by the company at P.T. 500 a ton. The Government receive a royalty out of this sum of no less than P.T. 310 a ton.</p> </div>

The Egyptian Estates bought the land at LE. 10 per square metre and sold it at L E. 15. Immediately after the purchase Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi were offered LE. 20, but refused to entertain this. The profit in the transaction realised by the Egyptian Estates accounts to close on £25,000.</p>

                THE POUTREL-DAVEY ACTION.</head>
                <p>At 10 a.m. yesterday the 2nd Chambre Civile of the Cairo Mixed Court was asleep, or st least nodding : oases of small importance Ironed along— some of the members of the Bench were obviously drowsy and the audience bored. At last Judge Herzbruch called the Poutrel Davey case,—No. 50 on the roll sod the audience and Bench awoke in earnest Me. Guilhanmon opened the case for his client shortly before 11 a.m. and for the next forty minutes kept the Court interested, for his speech contained some most interesting passages described in piteons terms the plight of M. Poutrel, summoned from Europe by an urgent wire and dismissed within three hours of bis arrival at Cairo, and then discussed the reasons of his dismissal. Obviously, the Hon. A. J. Davey and others bad sought a scapegoat and M. Poutrel had been selected for this office : the whole beard had done its utmost to escape from the incubus of their responsibility for the crash, some had failed, and the Hon. A J. Davey's attempts could impose on no one. How could he explain sway the letter that ha had written to his colleagues on the board ? -the letter containment  the statement of Mr. X, who informed the Hon. A. J. Davey in the Turf Club that Sir Ernest Cassel had told him in the presence of Birch Pasha many things, and this among others, that if he did not take the Sucreries in hand a smash was inevitable, and that he did not know how they got their dividends and meant to go into the question.”</p>
                <p>Counsel for the defence suggested that the letter might as well be produced. Mr. Guilhaumon declined, but stated that he believed in its existence and contained to take its most interesting passages as his text All, be said. pointed to the fact that the Hon. A. J. Davey knew all and had known all along before the crash, nor did he fail to avail himself of other arguments. Defendant had signed the balance-  sheets, could he have possibly been ignorant of their true meaning? And much more to that effect. Then back to the famous  letter : it existed, so he believed, but he would not produce it, and so saying he sat down at 11.35 a.m and Mo. Carton de Wiart took up the defence.</p>
                <p>Then came the first sensation Counsel for the defence would like to know whether plaintiff’s counsel had seen the original or  the copy of the letter. A brief verbal skirmish  followed, and then Me. Carton de Wiart startled the Court and the audience by the statement that the letter had been stolen "with effraction” from the Sugar Company’s safe, to which Me. Guilhaumon retorted that be was not the Public Prosecutor.</p>
                <p>Then came the defence. M Poutrel was bringing a personal action, but the Hon. A J. Davey had acted as he had done in his official capacity of administrator delegate, acting manager, in fact, of the whole business. On September 2l, he had written officially to the board concerning M. Poutrel, and the board had given him carte blanche to dismiss M. Poutrel or accept his resignation. The letter was there, and what evidence could be clearer? Then came another incident Me. Guilhaumon claimed that the letter had not been communicated to him. “No," replied Me. Carton de Wiart, "it was communicated to you last night,” and added that he had himself written to the papers on the subject stating that the Hon. A. J. Davey's conduct bad been approved by the hoard, and that Me. Guilhaumon bad replied also in the columns of the Press. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that tie Press was not the proper medium for the communication of documents. Counsel for defendant replied briskly and then Me Guilhaumon, on the ground that he had not studied or seen the document, asked for the postponement of the hearing. It was granted, and shortly before midday a most interesting trial was over—for the time.</p>
                <p>We regret that owing to an error in the telephonic transmission of yesterday's account of the proceedings, Me. Guilhaumon's name appeared as Me. Pangalo</p>

                <p>About eight yean ego a case of highway robbery and murder occurred in the Mariont district, which at that time was in the Kafr Dawar marker. A Bedouin, of the name of
                Abou Shalot, belonging to a family notorious for its lawlessness, was accused of the crime. He could not be found, so he was sentenced in his absence to penal servitude for life.</p>
                <p>The police have been persistently looking for him ever since, and about three years ago a rumour was brought to their ears that this man was lurking in the neighbourhood. The police officer in charge of the district, Abdul Axim Wahbi Effendi, went out into the desert on the criminal’s trail, but Abou Shalot laid an ambush for him and badly wounded the officer and placed a shawish and a naffir hors de combat, while he succeeded in making good his escape.</p>
                <p>For the last two years, since the Alexandria police have taken over the Mariont district, they have never ceased to look out for Shalot and on Monday morning, owing to secret in-formation, the mamour of the district, with an armed patrol of smart Sudanese policemen, went off eastwards from Amrieh and found Shalot in a home, waiting for them with a gun in his hand He was disarmed before he could do any damage, and was brought into Alexandria Yesterday in irons by an armed escort.</p>
                <p>The mamour and police of the Mariont district are to be congratulated on having so successfully run to earth such a dangerous criminal after so many years of search.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>GERMAN INFLUENCE IN BELGIUM.</head><p>A remarkable article from the pen of M. Schwob, a writer whose articles inspire confidence, appears in the "Aurore" (Paris), and is reproduced in part in the "Times." It suggests that the German economic conquest of Antwerp heralds the military conquest of the great Belgian seaport.</p><p>M. Schwob says that all Frenchmen will read with keen anxiety the results of his minute inquiry giving the details of the German occupation, which will gradually extend to all Belgium. They will see that a fifth of the members of the Chamber of Commerce at Antwerp are Germans, the president is of German origin and vice-president is a recently naturalised German. All its committees are invaded by Germans, eight having German chairmen, three others German vice-chairmen,and two with a completely German official staff. It is the same with the arbitration chambers. In addition to the list of avowed German firms in all branches of trade, which muster over 320 out of a total of about 1,550, M. Schwob says it is impossible for him to enumerate all the business houses which they control indirectly. </p><p>"As a great part of our merchandise passes through Antwerp it is watched, manipulated and labelled by them," writes Mr.Schwob, referring, of course, to French commerce. "They take note of our clients and of theirr tastes and then one fine day our custom will be stolen from us by skilful imitations at a reduced price. Even the banking business is invaded. Out of 14 administrators of the Central Bank in Antwerp, six, including the president and vice-president, are German."</p><p>M. Schwob further observes that the Germans are repeating the samme process at Rotterdam, but more slowly and with greater difficulty, owing to the more effective resistance offered by the Dutch. </p></div>

             <div type="item"><head>JAP COTTON MANUFACTURES.</head><p>The experiments now being carried on by the Tokio Government, with a view to rendering Japan more independent of Indian and American suppliies of raw cotton, have a very living interest for Lancashire. Should success crown the endeavor, the close proximity of the islands to China will necessarily give their cotton manufactures a great advantage in that almost limitless market.Our allies already possess the other leading requisites for supplying Chinese requirements. The cotton cloths they manufacture are both moderate in price and very durable, while the Japanese mill-hand willingly accepts wages on which Lancashire operatives would half-starve. They also work much longer hours, and their natural ingenuity in design gives them additional advantage. Up to the present, however, the still infant industry has been heavily handicapped by such an insufficiency of the raw material that nearly a million sterling per annum has had to be paid in gold for imports. The central purpose, therefore, of the Marquis Ito's personal inquiry in Korea is to ascertain whether that new appanage of Japan can be depended on to eke out the cotton producing resources of the islands. It will be seen that the object is much the same as that of the English Cotton Growing Association- the prevention of "cornering" by foreign speculators whenever the extraneous supply seems likely to run short of the world's wants.   </p></div>

             <div type="item"><head>ARE DISEASES INCREASING?</head><p>There can be no question, says the "Practitioner," that the prevalence of certain diseases has increased during the last half century. Conspicuous among these are diabetes and insomnia, both of which are largely due to the mental stress of a harder struggle for existence. The increased consumption of alcohol, and the free use of narcotics, are also responsible for many morbid conditions unknown to our hardier forbears. But, in comparing the present prevalence of diseases with that of the past, there are several facotrs for which due allowance is often not made. One of thses is that our forefathers died, as a rule, at a considerably younger age than thei descendants; if they did not perish by the sword, they were mowed down from time to time by the plague, or other devastating epidemics. In this way they escaped many of the diseases not only of old age but of advanced middle life. Again, it must not be forgotten that each generation represented to a much larger extent than is now the case the survival of the fittest. Most of the weaklings died in childhood. The triumph of modern hygiene is, that it has preserved a large proportion of these lives; on this we may fairly pride ourselves from the humanitarian point of view, but we must not shut our eyes to the fact that it has the serious drawback of lowering the general standard of health,and of sapping the vigour of the race. Another factor which must be taken into account in estimating the prevalence of diseases is our vastly greater power of recognising them. Discussing this question in an article which recently appeared in the "Nouvelle Revue," Dr. P.L. Hauser says:-</p>
             <p>"What then is the cause of the multiplication of disease? Is this multiplication merely apparent, being due first to the progress of natural science and then to the new knowledge which we have obtained with reference to pathology? While the fact of this new knowledge is indisputable this last hypothesis is insufficient to explain the absolute silence, maintained by the most distinguished physicians of past years, with reference to a great many of the diseases of our epoch. While biological science has made immense strides in recent years, we cannot deny to the physicians of ancient times a profound spirit of observation. Yet we look in vain for the least mention of diseases such as diphteria, progressive locomotor ataxia, progressive muscular atrophy, Parkinson's disease, Basedow's disease, general paralysis of the insane, and the different sorts of cerebrospinal sclerosis, all of which are frequent to-day."</p>
             <p>Dr. Hauser's remark is, the "Practitioner" thinks, too sweeping. A very fair description of diphtheria is to be found in Aretaeus. It is by no means safe to infer, because no mention is to be found in old writers of diseases of obscure and perplexing symptomatology, that they did not exist. This argument would equally prove that many other diseases are of modern development. Round ulcer of the stomach was so utterly unknown in the seventeenth century, that the discovery of the lesion at the postmortem examination of the body of a Royall princess was held to be a proof of poisoning, and for political reasons was explained away as the result of an awkward use of the scissors. Appendicitis again may be more common now than formerly, but we know that it did exist long before it was generally recognised, and it may fairly be assumed that it has existed since man had an appendix. Yet there is no mentionn of it in the ancient writers. </p></div>

              <div type="item"><head>AUSTRIA IN MACEDONIA.</head><p>There are four conflicting purposes which divide the European Powers on the question of Macedonia. The first is that of Great Britain, who is followed by France and Italy. It is altruistic and recognises that Macedonia should be freed from the Sultan. The second is the cynical policy of Germany, who desires to be friends with the Sultan, and is, therefore, hostile to the altruisic idea. The third was that of Russia before the war, which consisted in urging on Bulgaria to war with Turkey so that she might step in and promote a rec-ification of frontiers to her own advantage. The fourth policy is that of Austria, whose people are closely in contact with the Macedonians, whose traders have been first on the spot, and whose capitalists have acquired great interests in the country. As Mr. R. A. Scott-James points out in the "Fortnightly Review," Austria has nothing to gain by any sudden change in the Government of Macedonia, for if the present state of things continues, her securities in the country, and consequently her control of the country, will be such that she will have practically absorbed Macedonia, as Russia was in process of absorbing Macedonia, as Russia was in process of absorbing Manchuria. Peace and order are necessary to her plans, and she desires just so much reform as will stave off revolution without destroying the supremacy of the Porte. Austria has so far won all along the line, for the other five Powers, Russia owing to her misfortunes, have all waived their own policies and played into her hands, while the unfortunate people of Macedonia have continued to be the pawns of diplomatists.</p></div>

FRENCH PROTECTORATE RENOUNCED.</head><p>A telegram from Constantinople states that the Superior of the Italian Mission of the Franciscans, Father Joseph Caneve, celebrated a Requiem Mass there for the victims of the earthquakes in Calabria, in the presence of the Italian Ambassador and Consul-General, the officers of the Italian guardship, and the members of the Italian colony. It will be remembered that Father Caneve, in obedience to the orders of the Vatican, informed the French Ambassador at Constantinople, in September last, that being unwilling any longer to remain under the Protectorate of France he had placed himself under the Protectorate of Italy. The other religious missions sent their Superiors to the Requiem Mass, which inaugurated the taking possession of the Italian missions at Constantinople by the Italian Ambassador.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>BRITAIN AND ITS NEIGHBOURS</head><p>The "Edinburgh Review" takes a hopeful
                    view of the future relations of the Powers. In
                    sober truth, it remarks, is there reasonable
                    ground for anticipating the occurrence of a
                    life-and-death struggle between the British
                    Empire and a combination against it of the
                    great nations of the Continent? Is it quite
                    rational to anticipate a future in which the
                    United Kingdom, the centre of the commerce
                    of the whole world, will be perforce entirely
                    dependent upon its internal resources, and
                    will glare out, so to speak, from behind its
                    moat, and with its drawbridges raised, against
                    millions of encircling foes panting for its de-
                    struction? It is sufficiently lamentable that in
                    the early years of the twentieth century so
                    gloomy a prospect should loom before the eyes
                    of Englishmen. We have, assuredly, no right
                    to calculate on perpetual peace. It is possible
                    on the other hand, to give too much rein to the
                    imagination in picturing the dangers of the
                    coming years. . . . When we take a general
                    survey of our own position in either hemi-
                    sphere, we are quite unable to see that it
                    necessitates the taking of such gigantic mea-
                    sures as are recommended to us. Lord Roberts
                    is unjust in suggesting that the British people
                    are either indifferent to military matters or
                    that they are unwilling to make sacrifices. But
                    reasonable men ought at least carefully to
                    weigh the real danger of their condition before
                    they saddle themselves with burdens which
                    must greatly hamper the growth and prosperity
                    of the people.

                    Arab histories in which the statement is made

                    natives, spread broadoast the statement that
                    the white men were cannibals. The fact that,
                    they did not eat black men was explained as
                    due to their devilish onnniog. They wanted .
                    to make themselves strong in the oountry
                    before beginning their horrid praotioes; but, |
                    as they c >nld not altogether do without this
                    kind of food, they brought homao flash with
                    them in tins. Thus were the tinned meats
                    of the white man made to support this weird j
                    invention. It was only when his men refused 1
                    to eat the remains of a tin ot meat of whioh
                    he had himself partaken that a well-known |
                    explorer at lougth learned the legend.
                    Tbii was in Bast Central Africa, but in West i
                    Africa a French expedition had the unfor-
                    tunate experience of finding a portion of a |
                    human huger—cut off, no donbt, by some
                    aooident—in a tin of meat Here was fresh
                    and conclusive confirmation of the story, b
                    whioh the people had almost oeased to believe, |
                    and it was only after a considerable lapse of
                    time that the idea was at length eradicated.

                       Master Cotton Spinners’ and Manufacturers’
                       Associations, has sent to the press a copy of
                       the following communication he has received
                       from Mr. B. A. Calvin, president of the
                       Farmers' BdocatioDal and Co-operative Union
                       of America (Dills*, Texas) •— "The Farmers'
                       Educational and Co-operative Uoion of America,
                       which is composed almost exclusively of
                       cotton planters, was organised about three
                       years ago, and has grown (0 rapidly that to-
                       day we nomber almost a half-million members.
                       One of the main purposes of the organisation
                       is to establish a friendly bteroonrse between
                       the planter and the spinner, and. to this and we
                       are bending oar efforts. Your pablio ntterenoes
                       rooently have greatly enoonraged ns, and we
                       hope b the near fotnre to perfeot snoh an
                       arrangement with the spinners of the world
                       as to eliminate from the cotton trade a large
                       percentage of its speculative nature. Cotton
                       growers are gettbg tired of nnoertain condi-
                       tions and want to establish a medium through
                       which business can be done legitimately and
                       to the in tore-1 of both spinners and prodnoers.
                       Cotton growers do nrt want an exorbitant
                       price for their products, bat, on the oontrary,
                       they are willing to famish the world’s demand
                       »t fair and legitimate prices. They farther
                       want the prioe to be stable and at near uni-
                       form as possible. Conditions have forced ns to
                       keep on the ball ride of the market, and
                       unless something is done to relieve the situa-
                       tion, whioh is the result of nnnatnral and
                       unreasonable speculation, we will be forced to
                       organise more oompaotly for a great boll
                       campaign every time a season rolls round. If
                       you are willing to take the matter op with ns,.
                       I feel sore that arrangements can be made that

                       central service in Warminster in connection
                       with the revival in his diocese, depnoated the
                       disregard for human life. This was shown in

                <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Can any of your readers kindly enlight-
                        en me as to the correct derivation of the
                        common word “Galabieh"? Theliterary form
                        is said to be gulbab, plural, guldbeeb.
                    </p>
                <p>By chance I came across the following quotation in a Latin dictionary :- "Lebitonarium est colobium sine manicis quali monachi Egyptu utuntur," - the lebitonarium is a robe without sleeves, such as Egyptian monks wear. )Isidor. Orig. 7th century).</p>
                <p>on tracing colobium to the Greek lexican we find, of course, kolos, kolobos, - curtailed, shortened, and kolobion, an under garment with short sleeves. </p>
                <p>Is it possible that the Arabs, after their conquest of this country in the seventh century, adopted the native smock, and altered "kolobion" into "galabieh"?</p>
                <p>I have never been able to account for the double "b" in gulbab, galdbeeb. Was this literary form invented by Arabian lexicographers in the hope that the word might be taken to be of pure Arab origin?- You obedient servant,</p>
                <p>INQUIRER.</p>
