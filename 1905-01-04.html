Egyptian Gazette</span></h4><p>An English daily Newspaper, established 1880.</p><p>Price One Plastre Tariff.</p><p>WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4. 1905.</p><p>AFTER PORT ARTHUR.</p><p>The fall of Port Arthur has necessarily brought up the question of mediation or in- ervention, and a telegram from London this morning states that various inspired sug- estions in the direction of peace are emanating from Washington, representing Mr. Roosevelt as anxious to mediate but unable to move until approached by both the belligerents. Nothing whatever confirmatory has been receiv ed, and the peaee rumors are not credited. The scepticism prevailing in London is doubt- less well founded for we are still unable to believe that peace is near at hand. The fall of</p><p>Port Arthur does not necessarily imply that the Japanese will triumph in the war, for the capitulation of the Gibraltar of the Far East is probably only the end of the first act, and not by any means the drop scene, of the great drama. We believe that Ruarsa will fight to the bitter end, subject always to the condition that there is no general internal revolt. Such an occurrence is possible if the peasantry have ceased to fear a beaten Government, or are convinced that the war will drain them of too much of their strength, and if the soldiery are unwilling to put insurrection down ; but it seems to us most improbable. Very few Rus- sians realise what the loss of sea-power means, and fewer still are fully convinced that it has been lost. There has been no invasion, no cap- ture of any ancient Russian city, nothing to enable an unusually ignorant population to see the war. They feel the draft made on them by the summons to the Reserves, and they are disturbed by rumours that Holy Russia is not crushing her enemies with her usual com- pleteness ; but there has been no disaster sufficiently visible to destroy the mingled fear and reepect felt for the authority of the Tsar, or to induce the people to run the terrible risks involved in any insurrection not supported by the soldiery. So long as there is obedience the governing group in St. Petersburg can go on with the war if it will; and its material resources, except at sea, are not yet worn out, or even seriously affected. Even if the Russians have lost in the campaign two hundred thousand men through the hardships of transport, the out- bursts of sickness, and the deaths in actual fighting, these losses will soon be replaced by the conscription, more especially as most of the dead belonged to the Asiatic side of the vast Empire. The losses of officers, which have been frightful, are being made up. Better artillery, better powder, better muni- tions altogether, are all procurable for money; and the idea that the wealth of Russia has been-exhausted in less than a year of war is positively inept. The Treasury must provide for the interest on the Debt, and for all that is purchased abroad; but it has reserves of gold to meet those necessities, and everything procur- able at home can be paid for in paper, to be redeemed on the conclusion of the war. There are plenty of resources for a secoond campaign, and the great Russians are, as we believe, determined to fight one. They have at least three sets of motives, any one of which would induce them to adopt that course. They are as proud of Russia as we are of Great Britain, and would feel ultimate defeat by an Asiatic Power as an inexpiable shame. They are firmly convinced that their defeat has been due to unpreparedness, mismanagement, and corruption, and believe that with a few months for reorganisation they can collect a mighty army, resume the offensive, and in the next campaign drive the Japanese into the sea. And the governing classes feel, rather than see, that a shameful peace, especially if it included an indemnity, would be fatal to the autocracy; that is, would, in their judgment, be the precursor of anarchy, and probably of dismemberment.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.21_div.6"><h4><span class="headingNumber">2.21.6. </span><span class="head">CARLTON HOTEL</span></h4><p>Bulkeley, Ramleh.</p><p>Ten minutes from Alexandria.

Some time ago he deposited with his victims the sum of P.T.50,for the return of which he had applied on more than one occasion. His uncle, being in poor circumstances, was unable to pay the money and always postponed the time for doing so. At last, when the man’s patience was ex- hausted, he took a knife, went to his uncle’s house, and murdered both him and his wife, afterwards confessing his guilt to the Parquet.</p><p>St. Joseph’s Home, in the Moharrem Bey quarter of Alexandria, gave a delightful Christ- mas Tree fete yesterday. A large number of ladies were present including Mme. Girard, Mrs. Chataway, Countess de Zogheb, etc. The fine Christmas Tree was given by Mr. von Pitner. It was bedecked with innumerable toys and beautifully illuminated. The tree had been decorated by the ladies who organis- ed the fete. The delight of the children who are so well looked after at this excellent insti- tution was a treat to behold, and gave a well deserved pleasure to the lady patronesses, who had been at great pains to organise the fete for the children. The fete was in the first place due to the initiative of Mrs. G. Debbane, who was kindly assisted by the “Dames de l'Ouvroir des Mires Chretiennes” and by many young ladies of Alexandria.</p><p>The Egyptian Slave Trade. — An Anglo- Egyptian abolitionist has passed away by the death in London a few days ago of Mr. Charles H. Allen, F.R.G.S., who was for 19 years secre- tary of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, in his 81st year. Mr. Allen came of a Quaker stock. Throughout his life he showed special interest in the development of Africa. At first his attention was largely concentrated on Egypt, where the British Government had, recently undertaken great responsibilities. He received invaluable assistance from General Gordon in pressing for the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade throughout the Egyptian dominions; and seldom did General Gordon come to London without visiting Mr. Allen to discuss some plan for the liberation of the mil lions in the Dark Continent. A warm coadjutor was found from the first in Lord Cromer, who rendered splendid help, both by his general policy and also by promoting individual schemes such as the Home for Freed Woman Slaves in Cairo.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.8"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.8. </span></h3><p>GRAND HOTEL BONNARD, ALEXANDRIA.</p><p>2s.

The Bey has been 35 years in the service of the Egyptian Government, having entered the Customs Administration and Coastguard Service in 1870. In 1879 he was appointed Director of Customs at Suakin by the late General Gordon. This post he held till 1882, when he served in the Egyptian campaign on the Commissarist stall (medal and bronze star). He returned to Suakin in 1883, and served under Baker Pasha in the Intelligence and Commissarist Department and was subsequently appointed by the late Admiral Sir W.. Hewitt as Sub Governor, in addition to his duties at the Customs. In 1884 he was appointed Commander of the Imperial Order of the Medjidieh, and in the following year he was lent to the Intelligence Depart- ment by the Egyptian Government, and was attached to General Graham’s force. He was present at several actions and at the taking of Tamai, being mentioned in despatches. He remained in Suakin as Director of Customs until 1890, when he was transferred to the Coastguard Service at Alexandria as Secretary and Controller. In 1891 he was selected by the Khedive Mohamed Tewtik as his Private Secretary, and acts now in the same capacity to the present Khedive, his son. He already holds the rank of Bey of the first class, and is Commander of the Imperial Ottoman Orders of Osmanieh and Medjidieh, and Chevalier of the Francois Joseph Order.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.14"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.14. </span><span class="head">MOTORS IN CAIRO.</span></h3><p>The motor car is becoming, more and more one of the regular features of the traffic of the Capital, and it is satisfactory to note that the drivers are showing a reasonable regard for the convenience and safety of the public. There is one point, however, as to which it seems desirable to draw their attention. This is that the mere fact of their having a good clear stretch of road before them does not justify their driving at high speeds in narrow streets or near footpaths occupied by pedestrians. At any moment a tyre may burst, with the im- mediate consequence of whirling the car sud- denly round to the right or left, and plunging it into the midst of a crowd of passers-by with- out leaving these a chance of escape. Several fatal accidents have already occurred in Europe in this way.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.15"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.15. </span><span class="head">SHOUBRA BRIDGE SUBWAY.</span></h3><p>The new subway under the railway, that was to have been opened for public use during last month, is still far from complete, and we shall in all probability be well on into the new year before it will, or indeed can, be opened, The roadway has been pierced and the side walls built, but the iron roofing has yet to be fixed and the approaches constructed, and this means no small amount of labor. That, when completed, it will prove a great relief to the foot traffic over the Shoubra Bridge there can be no doubt, but, if it is to be rendered really effective, it will have to be placed under constant supervision, both with regard to the uses it may be put to and for the prevention of obstructions and blocking. Very much of its utility will depend upon the approaches, as if these are not convoniently placed and arranged they will very largely discount the value of the accommodation the tunnel will afford.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.16"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.16. </span><span class="head">PILGRIMAGE REGULATIONS.</span><br /><span class="head">NOTE BY THIS GOVERNMENT.</span></h3><p>A Note has been issued by the Government of explaining its intentions in imposing the regulations of this year upon the pilgrimage.

Last evening, at 7.30 on the occasion of the first performance, a crowd of natives assembled at the theatre, but did not enjoy the play for very long, as a lamp set fire to the canvas and the whole place was in a very short time burnt to the ground.' A panic ensued amongst the spectators, but they all managed to escape uninjured.

This gentleman denies nothing, but in the course of a columm of commonplace remarks he asserts that his company has a monopoly for seventy years to come. Such a statement will cause not a little surprise in London, and, we should imagine, to the shade Mr. Gladstone. To those behind the scenes Mn Bonnet’s ingenuousness is quite refreshing, for the leaders of the agitation for a new 1anal are hard at work upon their scheme.

MASPERO'S NEW TRANSLATION.</span></h3><p>M. Maspero has published a new translation of the stele of Userkaf (the Usercheres of Manetho) of the fifth dynasty, found by Prof. Petrie at Abydos. He thinks that if Prof. Petrie's copyist had been, as he says, “a professional Egyptologist," he (or she) might have been ablo to make a guess at many of the mutilated signs, and thus have oonsidorahly reduced the lacuna in the copy from which we now have to work. He does not agree with Mr. Griffith in the view that the inscription was originally written on papyrus, and afterwards transferred to stone, and he corrects the translation published by the last-named in 'Abydos IL' in several particulars. M. Maspero has also given a criticism of Dr. Erman’s recent ’Aegyptisches Glosaar,' in which he laments that Dr. Erman refers his readers in certain cases to his grammar only, and not to the texts on which it is supposed to be founded. As M Maspero says, it is necessary for beginners even more than for more advanced scholars that they should have an opportunity of check- ing for themselves the theories of the Berlin school, without being forced jurare in verbum magistri. Perhaps the sting of his criticism ies in the concluding words that the 'Gloasar' should prove useful to students at German universities and beginners in other countries.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.28"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.28. </span><span class="head">VERDI THEATRE DEBACLE.</span></h3><p>A Cairo correspondent writes:—</p><p>I see that the Verdi Theatre performances are few and far between at present, that ap- patently the company are losing over the ven- ture, in short, that they are likely enough to give it all up. It is the greatest possible pity. Here we have good, an excellent opera com- pany giving us just the repertoire which should appeal to us. The weary resident and the gay visitor do not usually want overmuch Wagner or the like ; they prefer these lighter operas, and yet no one seems to go. I admit that the Verdi Theatre has had one or two off-nights, viz, and to wit, Gioconda for one; but Mignon, Aida, Carmen, Otello, all were excellent. They have a surprisingly good orchestra. They have five or six leading players who are good enough for anything—Signora Monti-Baldini, Signor Tomisani, Signora Popovici—and I was told that Signora Svicher was very good. I have not been, I admit, to all the performances—by no means—but I have heard about those I did not see.</p><p>I will say at once that the raison d'etre of this article is not personal in any sense; it is more an expression of my wish to tell Cairo people in general (so far as they take any notice of my valued criticism) that if they wish to see a good light opera oompany, they havo the chance and I wish they would take it. It is pitiful to see the house emptier and emptier, and the performers less and less enthusiastic or inclined to do their best And I should imagine it is certain enough that if this Company gives up this their first attempt we shall get little enough chance of any further repetitions. I admit the locality is annoying, but the swift Cairo cabs make this of little account. Once in a way it may be said by some that they-let us put it so— prefer the environment, internal as well as external, of the Khedivial Opera House, but they can always take a box. And really it was the sight of those many empty boxes which moved me, as could no free seats or first-night suppers or other induce- ments (which same I haven’t had), to cover two sheets of paper — that, and the wish to hear the operas myself, for, O well- beloved visitors and residents, if you don’t en- courage the opera, the opera will vanish, and I shall have to go without! Invade the boxes, then, ye visitors and we, “poor devils on a fixed income," will, lessen our supply of ciga- rettes, and set apart the piastres necessary for our postri numerati, blessing you in that our economy is not unrewarded</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.29"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.29. </span><span class="head">PERSONAL AND SOCIAL</span></h3><p>General von Herwarth is expected at Shep- heard's Hotel shortly</p><p>Mr. MaeMillan, the American explorer, will arrive at Khartoum from the South in a few day's time.

BRITISH INTERESTS.</span></h3><p>The following article appeared in the latest issue to hand of the London Morning Post-</p><p>British trade with Egypt still compares favorably with that between the Khedive's subjects and any other nation. In round figures a third of the total imports are taken from this country, and a part of the remainder from our various colonies and possessions. It would appear, therefore, that there is greater reason to express satisfaction with such results than to utter any words of criticism or warn- ing. Yet a study of the import figures given in the latest issue of the journal of the British Chamber of Commerce in Egypt and of some of the consular remarks which the directors of the publication bare deemed it expedient to quote shows that complaisant satisfaction is not the attitude which it is desirable to com- mend. The reason is that we are not keeping the proportion of trade hitherto enjoyed. Egypt, as we have frequently pointed out, is making great strides forward as a buyer and as a seller. She is most fortunate inn having author- ities who are keenly alive to the development of all those means of transport which act as incentives to commerce. In this journal of the Chamber of Commerce we find a reoord which serves as a pertinent illustration of readiness to meet the views of the trading classes. Some years ago it was urged on these authorities that the Mahmoudieh Canal was not doing the amount or work of which it was capable.^. Abolition of the lock and bridge tolls was advocated with a view to facilitating navigation and increasing trade. In 1900 the tolls were in operation and the total number of boats which passed Atfeh was four thousand five hundred and sixty-four. In 1901 the tolls were abolished and the number passing rose to sixteen thousand seven hundred and twelvo, while last year it was twenty-three thousand and ninety-nine. At Kafr-Dawar lock the total in 1900 was thirteen thousand seven hundred and twenty-four, and last year it was thirty-five thousand seven hundred and thirty-two. These are amazing figures. Strong representations are now being made in favor of improving the facilities tor landing - goods at Cairo, and when this is carried out the water trans- port, especially by means of low-height sailing vessels, will be of far greater use and value. At the same time it should be remembered that Lord Farrer and Mr. Oliver K. H. Bury are engaged in a special inquiry as to the administration ot the State railways of Egypt, and it is expected that they will be able to make suggestions fur improving the efficiency of the public sen ice. Egypt, therefore, presents an attractive field which other nations are' ready to work to the greatest advantage. British trade, while holding a "very com- manding position," has to meet increasingly strong competition in almost all directions. The Earl of Cromer urges on his oouutry- men "greater adaptability to tho "wants of customers” not only in the form of the goods but also in the language and trade terns of circulars and prioe lists. His Lord ship regards the employment of more an 1 better-equipped travelling agents as a matter ot yet greater importance. Kecommeudatioua of the kind are so frequent that they lose some of their force. A glance over detailed figures of import for the first nine months of this year shows bow severe competition is in trades which we have developed to a high degree of efficiency. Of eighty .thousand pounds worth of boots only ten thousand pounds worth oarne from this country. We supply but a tenth of the imported furniture, and about tho same of the glass and china, though in earthen- ware tho percentage is far more in our favor. In brass, copper, and bronze we are masters, and send about two-thirds of the total, while in iron and ironwork our pro- portion is nearly four-fifths, and we send twice as much machinery aa all other countries. But we have but a small share of the ironmongery trade, and we are badly beaten in locomotives and irrigation pumps, though in portable engines it is Great Britain first and this rest practically nowhere. The figures suggest that oertain of our trades have made a great effort to meet Egyptian wants, and hare been successful, while in other direc- tions there has been that absence of adaptabi- lity whereon Lord Cromer comments. We do not draw attention to the state of trade for exclusively commercial reasons. The substan- tial advantage we enjoy ia well worth preserv- ing, and the outlook ia good enough to justify us in regarding Egypt as one of the best of the neutral markets. But there are also political reaaona for desiring to see our trade with the Khedive's possessions pros- pering. Though for the moment the pres- sure of international jealousies is relaxed, and wc may not feel embarrassed by the peculiarly undefined and almost (indefinable nature of' our relations with Egypt, it is im- portant to strengthen all the ties of interest that bind us to that country. Our predominant share of her trade is one of the solid grounds on which our protectorate may be justified, and its existence is an evidence that the relations which have boon established are not even sen- timentally irksome to the people. They will do more business with us if we are equal to the task of meeting every form of rivalry with skill and energy. Egypt noeds our manufactures, and is not likely to be a competitor against them. We, on the other hand, need her pro- duce as raw material for many of our indus- tries, so that there is a natural basis of per- manent exchange, from which the advantages should be mutual.</p></div><div class="item" id="deg-ad-aan02"><h3><span class="headingNumber">5.3. </span></h3><p>Anglo-American Nile Steamer &amp; Hotel Company</p><p>River Transport of Good Between Alexandria &amp; Cairo</p><p>Three Sailings a-Week.</p><p>Agents at Alexandria:</p><p>Alexandria Bonded Warehouse Co.

He was pleased to be able to say that thuir third exp tlition had now been sumo time at the mine, that work was progressing there rapidly and with excellent results, gold was being contin- uously sloped out, and monthly returns were being made, and unless some uuforaaeea diffi- culties arose there was every reason to believe that they would continue. The company was funned to take over an area on the N do Valley Company's concession. That area was held by them under a sub-licence, which expires in March, 1906. The directors have now obtained an extension of their Haimur holding for a further period of two years. They have also obtained mining leases of tho Haimur mines direct from tho Egyptian - Uovenuuout fora period of thirty years, with the right to renew for' a further period of filteen years, and at their option the right to determine in any year during those periods. The shareholders had therefore fixity of tenure as regards Haimur, in addition to their prospecting rights.</p><p>The Chairman continued : — Now with regard to your property at Haimur: during my visit to Egypt last year I visited Haimur in oompany with vour engineer, Mr. Harry Lake, when we made a thorough investigation of the property, and I am leaving England early in January for Egypt and intend to again visit your property with Mr. Lake. A great deal of development work was done at Haimur last season, in the course of wlich a considerable amount of gold was won, the proceeds of which have been placed to your credit, but owing to the fact that under our original holding we were debar- red by the Government from removing any more gold than was necessary to prove the property, practically no sloping was carried out. The bulk of the gold which was removed was that taken from the drives, rises and winzes, which were put in to prove the extent and richness of the mine. All this is now changed. 'ihe rich stone, tho existence of which we had proved but which we were compelled to leave before, we now have tho right under our leasee to win, and this is now beiug done. Tbe pay ground already opened up extends for a considerable distance longi- tudinally, and from tho highest to the lowest points at present opened up is a depth of some 400 to 500 ft. in proving your property, we have used our best endeavours to work on strictly economical linos, and with that end iu view we, have followed the trend of tho veins, putting in adits at different elevations aioug the hili-side and two prospecting shafts in Uie Waili, and where wo have out the formation we have driven on it and followed it down by menus of winzes, connecting up the different drives for purposes of ventila- tion. We still propose to pursue this method of development, and new having obtained our lease we propose to put down our main shaft and develop tbe property at depth. You will see on referring to tho drawing at the end of the report, which shows the trausverso sec- tion of the Haimur workiugs, that at, and uear, the surface on the hill they consist of a series of veins which run parallel, or nearly parallel, to each other. It baa been found, however, as we haye gone down on them that they are converging towards a single point. In fact the formauou suggests a cane which has split into a aeries ol smaller parts at the end although the main body of it remains in one piece. Whilst 1 cannot promise you that these parallel planes make together at one point, there appears from their trend to be a reasonable probability that they do so, and we now propose to put doVru our main shall to open up formation in the neighbourhood where we anticipate this is likely to occur, lu these parallel veins on which wo havo been working the veins have varied in thiokness and in productiveness. Some extraordinarily rich stone has been taken out, and quotiug from the report 1 see that in Adit No. 1. drive N. it is stated “some splendid milling ores have lately oome from tho bottom end of Winze N. giving up to some 50 oz. per ton over 4 to 6 in." On the other hand I see that 5 or. valoes have been obtained over 2 feet of reef, and what is oven more interesting, in the lowest parte of the workings in tho Wadi the formation runs as much as 10 feet wide.</p><p>With regard to water, without which, mining in tho desert is an expensive process, I must tell you that water is making its way into the bottom of the shaft in the Wadi, a depth of some 500 ft. from the highest point of tho workings, and approximately 800 ft below W*di level. I do not anticipate that this influx of water is going to create any difficulty, bnc on the contrary is going to be a very valuable asset, and indeed will materially lessen the cost of working there. I hope I have mado it clear to you bom the fore- going remarks that , you have a valuable property in Haimur, in addition to your other interests, that a large amount of pay ground has already been proved and is now being profitably workod, and that your Board propose m the immediate future to farther open up the mine, and generally to develop your pro- perty on energetic lines. I would call your attention to the very moderate capitalisation of your oompany, and in oonoluaion would point oat that a large number of fooee are now being worked and stone is being taken out whichitu estimated will average from £10 to £12 per ton nett profit, and it is anticipated that regular shipments will be made which will enable the Company to develop its property.</p><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.4_div.1"><h4><span class="headingNumber">5.4.1. </span><span class="head">Vinolia </span></h4><p>For the Skin</p><p>Soap, Cream, Powder.</p><p>For delicate sensitive irritable skins. 5 kinds: premier floral, toilet, medical and vestal.</p><p>For itching face spots and all skin irritation.</p><p>for redness, roughness, toilet, nursery.

He is hewn to endure aa many troubles as the rest of mankind. Mr. Arthur F. Brookes, of 25, Tho Arcade, Wol- verhampton, has travelled through many I countries with his camera, but in London his | professional career was threatened. "1 was ill," j he said, "and none of the doctors knew what was the matter. But Dr. Williams' pink pills i for pale people found my trouble and ourod it 1 was terribly ‘run down.' My nerves seemed to have left me, and at sight of food my stomach would turn. When I forced down a little food to keep up my strength, the pains in my chest were excruciating.</p><p>“Two eminent doctors said I was snflering from nervous prostration, and ordered oomplete rest. I was under them six months, but soon after was as ill as ever. 1 had such pain in my bank as to make me cry out and clutch at the first thing I came to.</p><p>“I attended a hospital for two months, and my case puzzled evou the clever doctors there. Reduced to a mere skeleton (for eating was impossible) 1 lingered in a dreadful state until four months ago I met an old triend who asked me why 1 didn’t try Dr. Wilburns' pink pills— they always set him up. 1 purchased a box, and it made me a great deaf better. By the time 1 had finished a second box 1 was rapidly putting on flesh. My appetite returned, and 1 enjoy my meals now, without any ill alter-ctlocta. My improved health, after only three boxes, is a revelation. 1 have not toll so well for over ten yean as 1 do at the present I time. There bus never been the least retain of the pain.”</p><p>Nerves broken down by irony and work set up the most difficult fora of chronic indi- gestion. Broken uervas are nerves starved for the want of blood. Dr. Williams' pink pills for pale people—genuine only with lull name, seven words—make blood, limy banish aroenua and the pains that afttict the weaker sex. But they are equally valuable for men, having cured indigtnuou, palpitations, bile, nervous depression, sciatica, rheumatism, paralysis, Sl Vitus' dance, and nervous disorders. Two shillings and uwopeuce tor one box, or thirteen and nine tor six sent to Dr. Williams' medians Go., Molboro-viaduot, London, will bring the pills by return poet. But they can be had at medicine shops, it readers insist on the genuine.</p><p>It is a Painful Portrait that the Photo- grapher whose case is described above gives of himself. His experience should be a guide to others.</p><p>Sold in Egypt by all chemists at P.T. 18 per box or F.T. 70 per 6 boxes.
