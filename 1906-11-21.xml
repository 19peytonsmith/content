                    <p>MESOPOTAMIA AND BRITISH</p>
                    <p> ENGINEERS.</p>
                    <p>While the Bagdad Railway still linger, on its way eastward, the fertile delta
                        of the Euphrates is being slowly but surely developed by the Daire Sanich of
                        His Imperial Majesty tbe Sultan. Large new-areas are being brought under
                        cultivation, tho riverine trade is increasing rapidly, and tho railway, when
                        it readies its goal, will traverse for the last 200 miles of its route a
                        district where much has been done to repair the neglect of centuries. With
                        the opening up of the country to trade and the incrcaao of cultivation, the
                        demand for mechanical appliances of every description is bound to increase,
                        and from news received from what wo believe to be a well-informed source, we
                        gather that there is already a considerable demand for oil pumps at Basra
                        and Bagdad. Hitherto the general want of technical skill has militated
                        against their introduction. It is all very well to introduce machinery, but
                        what if none of tho purchasers are ablo to instal it or to manage it when
                        installed 1 The answer is simple: tho engineering firms must themselves
                        undertake the instruction of the purchasers. They will have to do, not with
                        stupid barbarians, but with a race that possesses many of the best
                        characteristics of the Egyptian, joined to quicker wit. and greater
                        readiness to accept responsibility. And if British engineering firm, with to
                        share in the profita that will certainly accrue to the engineering trade os
                        a whole from tho opening up of Mesopotamia they must set to work themselves
                        to push their machinery and to instruct their clientele how to moke the most
                        advantageous use of their purchases.</p>
                    <p>What is required to ensure success is tho dispatch to the spot of a competent
                        and responsible representative of tbe British engineering trade. He should
                        virit Mesopotamia in the winter, make local enquiriea, give reliable
                        technical advice, provide estimates, and receive orders. He should be
                        accompanied by a reliable and tactful fitter, who would stay for at least a
                        year os a trial, and who could bn trusted to put up pumps so that they would
                        work at their maximum efficiency, and repair any machines that get out of
                        order. He should also be prepared to give instructions to persons to bo
                        employed in taking charge of pumps. Let a combination of British firms tako
                        this course, and they will have an excellent chanco of securing this market
                        for British machinery. If they wait, the lapse of every month brings with it
                        a greater risk that French or German firms will enter the field. If the home
                        firms are unwilling to try the experiment arc there no British engineering
                        companies in Egypt with the imagination and vigour to tackle the problem 1

                        Revenue L.E. 221,000 Expenditure „ 217.3rO Reserve L.E. 3,700 The continual
                        progress of the municipal sources of revenue, says Mr. Chataway,. allows him
                        to foresee for 1907 receipts exceeding by L.E. 26.000 those embodied in the
                        Budget of 1906 This satisfactory augmentation is mainly due to increased
                        revenue under the head of the tax on buildings (LE 7,80>), the tax on
                        carriages and beasts of burden (L.E. 4,1' 0), the 2% house tax L.E. 2,500;,
                        road dues (L.E. 3.2C0), quarry dues (LE 2,500), abattoir receipts (L E.
                        2,000;, etc. After referring in detail to the various heads of revenue the
                        Administrator says that the fact matt not be lost sight of that the
                        budgetary equilibrium is only last maintained by the Municipality’s present
                        resources, and that if the budget has sensibly increased, it is far from
                        having reached the amount whioh the needs and charges of the city will
                        shortly necessitate for .the upkeep of all the new works which have already
                        been undertaken, and which the flesh extraordinary resources will allow them
                        to undertake in a more or less early future, for the sanitation, aeration,
                        and embellishment of the town. Chataway Bey adds : — "The creation of a big
                        reserve suggested by me in a previous report is logically dependent on the
                        importance of the excels of receipts over expenditure ; it is then fore
                        materially impossible, unless by a reduction of expenditure—to the detriment
                        of the real needs of our various services—to establish a bigger reserve, so
                        long as fresh resources do no arise to increase the present revenue of the
                        ordinary Budget, the more so as the budgetary estimates of revenue reflect
                        exactly all that we shall be able approximately to euros in 1907, and the
                        amount of which it would be imprudent to raise.” As regards expenditure, the
                        estimates are established in such a manner as to ensure the working of the
                        services not only such as tiny had been provided for in 1906 but also
                        according to the situation and with the extension which they have undergone
                        since. The report says that, taking into consideration the obligatory or
                        unforeseen expenditure which the Municipality has to meet with its ordinary
                        resources, and the desire expressed by the Municipal Delegation concerning
                        the inscription on the Budget of 1907 of a reserve more to keeping with the
                        needs of the city, the amount of the grants made annually by the
                        Municipality to the various benevolent societies and other institutions, and
                        which conatitate optional expenditure (less the amount set aside for the
                        free distribution of water to the poor), might be deducted from the ordinary
                        Budget, to be included henceforth in the extraordinary Budget. Chataway Bey
                        adds : "While folly recognizing the useful work done J)y these institutions,
                        I consider it more regular and more in conformity with the regulations and
                        the interests of the administration itself not to take out of the ordinary
                        Budget funds which might be devoted to maintenance and the obligatory
                        expenditure of the city. Io this way the reserve of the ordinary Budget will
                        be brought up to LE. 9,231.” </p>

                    <p>This company has been formed with a capital of £500,000, divided into 498.750
                        Ordinary shares of £| each, and 25.000 Deferred shares of 1s each.. The
                        Ordinary shares are entitled to a preferential dividend of 7 per cent and
                        will participate with the Deferred shares in the remaining profit available
                        for distribution, the Ordinary share taking sixty per cent., and the
                        Deferred shares the remaining forty per cent. There will be an issue of
                        298.750 Ordinary shares, payable as follow* :—2s. 6d per share on
                        application; 2s. 6d. per share on allotment; and the balance in calls not
                        exceeding 5s. per share, at intervals or not less than three months. The
                        subscription list will be opened on the 10th December, 1906, and closed on
                        or before the 1th December 1906. One-third of the whole issue will be
                        reserved for Egypt. The directors are Major-General Sir John C. Ardagh, K
                        C.M.G.. K C.I.E, C.B., repre sentative of H.B.M.'s Government on the Board
                        of Administration of the Suez Canal Company; Mr. Elias Meyer, of Meyer Bros
                        , Calcutta. and R Meyer &amp; Co., Singapore; and Mr. Gerald Arthur
                        8beppard, deputy-chairman of Egyptian Estates, Limited. The advisory board
                        in Egypt consists of Mr. John Hicks Pauli and Neghib J. Sarsock Bey. The
                        Egypt secretary will be Mr. Errol Kerr, C. A., of Messrs.Russell, Kerr and
                        Wyatt, Alexandria and Cairo. The company has been formed especially to carry
                        on business in Egypt and the Sudan. The attention of the Board will, as
                        opportunities present themselves, be more particularly directed .to: The
                        purchase, development and subsequent leasing or re-sale of agricultural and
                        building land ; the lending of money, on mortgage or otherwise, on land or
                        other approved securities ; the carrying on of the business of an investment
                        company. The company will mainly devote itself to the development of
                        selected agricultural estates with a view to their rental or sale to natives
                        in plots suitable to their requirements. The directors consider themselves
                        fortunate in having secured the services of Mr. John Hicks Paoll, as
                        agricultural adviser for a period of three years. Excellent opportunities
                        frequently occur of leading money on first mortgage at good rates and with
                        an ample margin. With a local advisory board composed of business men ot
                        high standing and long experience in Egypt good profits may reasonably be
                        expected from this and other forms of investment which require special local
                        knowledge. The company has acquired from the H. and J. Syndicate, Limited,
                        the right to purchase an estate of 4,793 feddans (say 5 000 English acres),
                        situated some miles south of Alexandria and connected by a line of tramway
                        with the Delta Light Railways system. The estate is a going concern, with
                        ample farm buildings, stock, plant, etc. It his excellent soil and an ample
                        water supply. Mr. Lang Anderson reports that it is "a! property capable of
                        great development at! moderate cost and that if £30,000 be judiciously spent
                        on it during the next five years it can be brought to a capital value of
                        from . £75 to £80 per feddan.” He farther adds that "the work of development
                        is simple and follows well-known lines, so that the element I of unforeseen
                        contingencies iB largely diminish- I ed, while the results of development
                        are sure.” The present rental value of the estate is nearly £1,000 per
                        annum, derived from an area of under 1,000 feddans let to natives, and Mr.
                        Anderson sees no reason why, when folly developed, the estate should not
                        yield an annual revenue of at least £21,500, whilst its capital value may
                        reasonably be expected to improve by from 70 to 80 per cent The directors
                        have other business in view which is believed to be a most profitable nature
                        ; as, however, negotiations are still in progress, it is not possible to
                        give details at present. All the agricultural properties already acquired as
                        well as those in contemplation have been treated with after personal
                        examination by Mr. LaDg Anderson. </p>
                    <p>The Khedive</p>

                        the evening. There will be a reception on the platform of the Moharrem Bey
                        terminus at 7.30 a.m. on the 24th inst. on the occasion of the Khedive’s
                        departure from Alexandria for Cairo. A guard of honor of 100 rank and file,
                        commanded by a captain, with two subalterns, the King’s colour and band to
                        the 1st Battalion Linooshire Fusiliers, will mount at Cairo railway station
                        at 11.15 a.m. on Saturday next, on the occasion of the arrival of the
                        Khedive. The Khedive will bold his first reception on his return to Cairo
                        for the winter en Monday morning next. His Highness dispatched the usual
                        congratulatory telegram to the Sultan on the occasion to Beyram. </p>

                    <head>(From our Theatrical Correspondent)</head>
                    <p>Jane Hading was all and more than we had hoped to see and hear. She had a
                        perfection of gesture, voice, intonation.—all that the French school has at
                        its highest. In the play given, "La Princesse George” she somehow gave the
                        personality and note of the piece, and yet her own self was at its strength:
                        it was, in fact, the Princess played by Jane Hading, and not Jane Hading
                        alor.e. submerging all the play. The piece is not profoundly interesting in
                        itself, except for one or two moments of excitement, and of course the
                        revolver incident at the end; it has the touch of discorsiveness and
                        sentimental philosophy ore find* in Domas fils.. This was marked with the
                        other actor*. They are excellent of their kind and play well np to Jane
                        Hading herself; bat the piece, the traditions of—well—elocution, and even
                        the theatre in which they were playing bad their effect. The "asides,” for
                        instance, were almost shouted. But the Abbas Theatre is not good for acting,
                        and the voice does not carry well. Jane Hading has to impersonate a woman
                        deceived, and forgiving, again deceived, then resolute, but conquered by her
                        love after all, and then happy in that she has driven out her rival and sent
                        that rival’s lover to face the pistol of an infuriated husband ; the prince
                        returns unhurt, and after all not the archdeceiver she feared. Her
                        impersonations was as great as can be imagined. That touch we have spoken of
                        discursive and sentimental, did not appear : every word, every movement, was
                        natural; now passionate, now proud, pleading, forgiving, jealous,
                        condemning, she held the whole theatre. Her influence caught one by the
                        throat, as it were. And what a voice ! We have heard the ultra- correct
                        Theatre d’Orange declamaton. the Opera Ccm que elocution, the exaggeration-
                        shriek for certain crises, Mme Granier, the woman of the world. None were
                        quite so perfect and true. Yet we did notice once or twice—always when she
                        was alone on the stage, never when playing with one of the others Just a
                        touch of forced note. At one moment there was a suspicion of deep tone as of
                        Sarah, and now and again the voice rose high, and the ge9tare seemed
                        excessive. That may have been the seven days at Alexandria, or the audience
                        of Monday night; one expects it in the Khedivial Theatre ! But her great
                        effect, the tease, harried, passionate whisper, and then at the last that
                        strangled shriek of despair ! How can actresses rant and boom and howl when
                        such wonders can be done by other means ! And again the “voix terne”
                        lifeless and light less when her love gave way before damning proofs : it
                        was all a wonder. We have spoken of the others. The prince was good enough,
                        ai was Galanson, MM. Amaod and Grammont ; and Victor gave the right note of
                        the perfect valet waiting to make money, and repenting a moment ; but his
                        asides j irred greatly. Ha need not have compromised with the theatre
                        acoustics to such an extent. Sylvanie de Terremoode (Laure Sarean) was too
                        theatrical. She might have been Winifred Emery playing a character of 3etoo
                        Merriman’s, and over accentuating her points. The other ladies were all a
                        little traditional ; and their pronunciation was almost too corrupt. This is
                        not to say that they were not one and all far better than, say, the average
                        Khedivial troupe. The house was not very fall, bat it is a big theatre, and
                        then unless one is well in front it is very difficult to hear properly. The
                        management might perhaps give a little more notice when the curtain is going
                        to rise. We are sure they will ; they are always most courteous and careful.
                        But on Monday night at the beginning of each set there was a certain amount
                        of disturbance. People only just found out that the curtain was op. and had
                        to get to their places while the play was going on. </p>
                    <p>Jerusalem Consulate.</p>
                    <p>Appointment of New Cousul</p>
                    <p>Jerusalem, November 17. Mr. Edward Charles Blech, who since 1894 has held the
                        post of dragoman archivist to the British Embassy at Constantinople, has
                        recently been appointed his Majesty’s Consul for Palestine, to reside at
                        Jerusalem. He arrived here this morning, but will not enter upon hi official
                        duties until next May, having obtained leave of absence. He intends to
                        return to Constantinople after a couple of days to join his family homeward.
                        Mr. F. G. Freeman, his Msjssty’s Consol at Trebizond, will oontinue to take
                        obarge of the Consulate until Mr. Blech’s return. The nomination of Mr.
                        Bleoh, who is still a young man, is hailed with much satisfaction here. His
                        ability and thorough knowledge of the Arabio and Turkish languages, coupled
                        with the vast experience he has acquired of Turkish affairs during a long
                        residence in the Capital and in other parts of the Ottoman Empire, would
                        seem to well qualify him to fill the post for which be has been selected. </p>

                    <p>Internal Discontent In Germany.</p>
                    <p>On the eve of the meeting of the Reishstag General von Podbiflski’s
                        resignation has been accepted. The Prussian Minister of Agriculture leaves
                        office adorned with the insignia of one of the most illustrious Orders which
                        his Sove reign has to bestow. His retirement will nevertheless be generally
                        regarded as a recognition of the force and authority of public opinion. The
                        late Minister was unpopular with the masses of the German people because of
                        the extreme views upon agricultural protection which he shared with the
                        narrowest and the most conservative of the Prussian Agrarians. His policy
                        has left its mark upon the new treaties of commerce which Germany has been
                        concluding with her neighbors, and at home it is regarded as one of the main
                        causes of the great rise in the cost of meat which is occasioning such
                        widespread discontent in the</p>
                    <p>Fatherland.................................................................. </p>
                    <p>The sacrifice is, no doubt, expedient, bat it will hardly suffice to assuage
                        the general discontent and. uneasiness-t which are said to pervade almost
                        all classes of the German nation. These feelings have their root in causes
                        far wider and deeper than resentment at the conduct of an individual
                        Minister, or even than displeasure at the general conduct of public affairs.
                        They arise not from the mismanagement of those affairs, though with a nation
                        which has its full share of vanity this doubt- leas has helped to influence
                        them, but from the great and growing dissatisfaction that the management of
                        the country should remain exclusively confined to the present, hands. An
                        influential South German newspaper boldly attributes them to what it calls,
                        with some petulance perhaps, a “crisis of absolutism.” The phrase is
                        exaggerated, but that it expresses a truth no observers who have watched the
                        growth of modern Germany, and the dove lopment of political thought within
                        her borders, will question. ("TiroFs”).</p>
                    <p>A Plea for Official Recognition.</p>
                    <p>Sensitive as they are to fluctuations in international prestige, the subjects
                        of William II. are, at present, more nearly concerned with the prolonged
                        negation of their civic rights. They cast their eyes abroad, and see that
                        the peoples of less intellectual and less progressive countries have a
                        definite voice in the management of their domestic affairs. A Frenchman, an
                        Italian, V1 Austrian, or -Hungarian, even a Bulgarian or Servian, can take
                        his part in the making or unmaking of a Ministry. In Germany, if there is a
                        "Chancellor crisis, ’ the electors are but an audience invited to witness a
                        show which is planned and managed behind</p>
                    <p>the scenes................................................................... </p>
                    <p>The situation would, perhaps, be considered less intolerable if the only
                        parties concerned were Emperor and Reichstag, King and people. Bat between
                        the Monarch and his subjects stands the Court camarilla, a clique of
                        flatterers and adventurers, whose business it is to prevent the Ruler from
                        ascertaining the mind and thought of the nation. If we may believe the
                        journals—which are, without distinction of party, practically unanimous—the
                        courtiers are only too successful in the arts of mystification. They play
                        alike cn the finer impulses of the Emperor’s character and on the lees noble
                        traits—on his generosity, his self reliance, and his vanity. Nihil estquod
                        credere de se Nod possit cum laudatur dis a qua potestas. It is hard,
                        indeed, for an absolute Ruler to ignore adulation and set a limit to his own
                        capacity. ( ‘Standard.”)</p>
                    <p>Belgium and the Congo.</p>
                    <p>In the course of his speech at the Guildhall banquet on Friday last, the
                        Marquees of Ripon pointed out that the be3t solution of the Congo difficulty
                        lay in the annexation by Belgium of the territories of the Free State, which
                        thenceforward would exist only as a Belgian colony. In that event it may be
                        assumed that Belgium’s national pride could not for a moment allow her to
                        countenance the perpetuation of the system with which the rule of her
                        Sovereign in Africa is unhappily associated, if she should decide to take
                        this step and to assume the burden which would thereby be cast upon her, she
                        may be well assured that she will be hampered by no interference on the part
                        of this country. Rather than that she may rely on the energetic sympathy of
                        all persons who have recognized that in this course lies the salvation of
                        the Congo natives. If, however, Belgium should not see her way to undertake
                        this duty, then, as Lord Ripon pointed out on Friday, it will be for this
                        country and the other Powers to consider what concerted action may be taken
                        to enforce the provisions of the Berlin Act of 1885 (“Morning Post.”)</p>
