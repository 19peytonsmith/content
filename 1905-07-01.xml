SPEECH BY LOBD CROMER.
THE
CONDITIONS OF EGYPT'S
PROGRESS.
^Special Cable to the Gazette. )
/ \ __________________
London, Jnne 30.
The Earl of Cromer has jecei^Sft the honorary
freedom of the Skinners’ Company. His lord-
ship, in replying to. the toast of his health,
declared that the ADglo French Agreemeut
had been of unmixed benefit to all whb had
to deal with the local affairs of Egypt and
wore now relieved from the constant friction
and annoyance that haul marked the past.
The story circulated in the Press to the effect
that representations had been made to H.H.
the Khedive as to the presence of British
troops in Egypt was purely mythical. Four
conditions were necessary to secure the uniform
progress of Egypt : first, no hurry; second,
that Egyptian affairs should be kept outside
the domain of British party politios ; third,
that the utmost care should be taken not to
force Western ideas and exotic institutions
upon the Egyptian people before the country
was ripe for their assimilation; fourth, that
Egypt should continue in the future as in the
past to be governed in the interests of the
Egyptians themselves.

London, Jnne 30.
The Earl of Cromer, speaking at the banquet
of the Skinners’ Company, dwelt upon the
benefit to Egypt caused by the Anglo-French
entente, and the valuable co-operation of the
Egyptian Government. His relations with the
, Ihedive were most satisfactory.

Seizure of Hashish.—On Wednesday and

awaiting an opportunity to pass it to the
shore, which is so well guarded that it is
now a matter of extreme difficulty to land
hashish. Before the transfer of the above

guards got wind of its concealment and
seized it.

that many modem Americanisms were in use

LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.
^(From our owit Correspondent.)
1	Sfiez, Friday.
As I advised yon this morning by wire, I
proceeded on board the Russian cruiser
“Dnieper” (ex “St. Petersburg”) In order to
interview the crew of the sunken British
steamer “St. Kilda,” but the officer on duty
absolutely refused tc allow me to see any of
the British offioers, saying that it was strictly
forbidden. He added at the same time that
they would probably oe landed at Fort Said.
I understand, however, that the S.S. “St.
lilda” left Hongkong for Yokohama on the
4th June, with a ctpgo of rioe, cotton, and
Bmp, and wh« 40 miles oat she met the
laSStaff cruiser "Dnieper,” which signalled to
ler to stop. A "prize crew was subsequently
put on board, and next- day, when the orew
iad*been removed, the oruiser sank the “St.
lilda” after firing ten shots. All the personal
effeots belonging to the orew were lost. 41 of
the Chinese crew belonging to the “St Kilda”
were transferred to th&putoh steamer “Flores”
and landed at Singapore, while the British
officers were retained and brought here.
It is remarkable that' the “Dnieper,’’ in spite
of the long voyage and the heavy seas she en-
countered, has the appearance of having been
recently drydocked. She is heavily armed with
arge and small machine guns, and fitted with
wireless apparatus. She is also flying the naval
flag. J
At about 9.30 a.m. to-day the Russian com-
mander paid an official call on the commander
of the British battleship "Canopus,” whioh was
duly returned. The same offioial calls were
exchanged later on between the battleship
“Goliath,” whi6h arrived at 10.30 a.m., and
the “Dnieper.”
The battleship “Goliath” was reported by
the “Canopus” as approaching Suez at 7 a.m.,
>eing in wireless communication with her.
Finally the battleship “Canopns” entered
the Canal at i 1.15 this morning. *
The "Goliath” left at 1.40 this afternoon,
and the “Dnieper” at 1.55 for Port Said, where,
!, understand, she will take in abont 300 tons
of ooal, not having taken anything at this
port.
DANGEROUS GAMINS.
We wish to call the attention of the an tho-
rites to the dangerous use of catapults in the
streets by European and Arab boys. These
gapiins appear to be supplied with up-to-date
weapons, and samples of their ammunition
which we have seen look most formidable,
small bolt heads and chopped iron bars being
the pattern most in favour. Every evening
parties of boys may be seen in the quieter
streets, especially in the Moharrem Bay quarter,
shooting at the small birds whioh settle on the
tamarisks planted'by the road. We imagine'
that the use of catapults on the public roads is
forbidden, and there can be nodonbt about the
i’legality of their use when missiles are fired
into gardens with disastrous consequences to
windows and grave risk to the eyesight of
those who happen to be in the line of fire.
Even the Mohamed Aly-square is rendered
unsafe : the windows of St Mark’s Church
have repeatedly been broken by stones and
lamps of iron. Mr. Casimatis, of the Anglo-
Egyptian Bank, wtifr is also in charge of part
of the business administration of the church,
has made an interesting collection of ammuni-
tion fired into the windows and has oaptured
two of the oplprits, whom he handed over to
the police—without any obvious result. This
morning the bowab of the church^w^s struck
on the left side of the face by a stone from a
! catapult which infiioted a very nasty wound.
Had the missile struck the unfortunate man
an inch higher he would probably have lost
the sight o^ one eye. We hope that the autho-
rities will take steps to render the repetition
1 ot the offence highly dangerous tothe offenders.

V (From our
(From our own Correspondent.) >
Port Said, Saturday.
After considerable difficulties had been pnt
in my way I at last obtained an interview
with Captain Jones, of the S.S. “St. Kilda.”
Captain Jones states that' the “St. Kilda”
left Hongkong on June 2 last. The EuropBNl
crew refused to proceed to Japan and were
landed at Hongkong on Jane 3 and impri-
soned. A Chinese crew was shipped and
the "St. Kilda” sailed for Yokohama on the
same day.
'On June 4 the Russian erniper “Dnieper”
stopped and.captured the “St. Kilda,” putting
a prize orew on board. The ships proceeded at
a speed of nine knots in oompany into deep
water and at 6 a.m. on the 5th June an un-
successful attempt was made to sink the
“St. Kilda” by means of dynamite, after
the crew had been taken off. The Russians
then opened fire with their quick-firers and
sank the captured vessel with 16 4.7 inch
projectiles at 10 a.m.
The “St.-Kilda” was bound from Rangoon
to Yokohama with a cargo of rice, cotton, and
sugar. The “Dnieper” had been warned of
her departure by Russian agents at Hong-
Jcong. After the vessel had been sank the
Chinese crew were put on board the S.S.
“Flores,” bound for Singapore.
The prisoners, who were thirteen in number,
were well treated on the “Dnieper,” being each
allowed a cabin and having perfect freedom
of movement abont the decks.
The commander of the “Dnieper”' refused
to receive the visit of the captain of H.M.S.
•’Lancaster” this morning. The Russian cruiser
carries eight 4.7q.f. -guns and 27 pieces of
smaller calibre ; she is bound for Libau and
the prisoners have received orders to disembark
at Port Said to-night.	.
MENZALEH CANAL AND
NAVIGATION CO.
This new company, founded last year, hopes
to inaugurate tk6 Port Said to Matarieh
branch of its service across Lake Menzaleh
about the middle, of October. The Matarieh
to Damletta seotion will also be completed
soon after, dredging operations being now
hastened for that purpose. The distance
between the former two places is some 28
kilometres, and the same distance separatee;
Damietta from Matarieh, where the lake service
works in oonneotion with the passenger trains
of the Compagnie des Chemins de for de la
Basse Egygte to Mansourah and at the latter
town in coincidence with those of the Sta’e
Railways.	c
In Ootober therefore there will be a through
service between Cairo and Port Said by rail-
way and passenger steamer. For the latter
traffic there are two stem-wheelers for passen*
gers besides two tugs and six lighters for
the freight traffic. All these were constraoted
in England, brought out in sections, and put
together at Karputi, near Port Sail, by the
Anglo-American Nile Steamer Co., who have
entered into a contract to work the lines of
the Menzaleh Canal and Navigation Company
for two years from the date of inauguration.
The steamers have good aooommodation each
for a certain number of first and second class
passengers, besides 15^> of the third class.

A correspondent writes:—Apropos of ao*
oidenti on this railway, they are of almost
daily occurrence now. On Friday last the
Nesleh engine broke down as it was about
to leave for Fayoum ; another engine was
sent, but never reached its destination, and
as no other was available passengers and
train had neoessarily to wait ontiKohe of
the other branch trains arrived at Fayenm,
when -tiiat engine was sent and succeeded
in returning home with its unfortunate com-
panions “hours late.”
The Shawashna train on the same day
was never seen at Fayoum. A few days ago
a funeral party ordered a "special” for 3 p.m.
for Daire el Azab^j they arrived and had to
sit in the train in the broiling afternoon
sun until 5.30 p.m., when the engine from
Lahoon took the train. No other was available.
Last year the traffic receipts were published
pretty regularly and always showed an increase.
It would interest many to know' why they
are now suppressed, as LE. 300 a month
will not cover the decrease of receipts, and
from what ean be gathered it is likely to
be still more. It really is time the publio
were better served and these directors were
stopped Splaying at railways,” lor I am told
that the native who is “running the show” at
the moment, seising the moment'of chaos,
actually threatened to resign “playing at

of receipts, I hear he&4So have an increase

THE DANGER.
(Continued.)——■
-The great line that runs tike an artery
rom Constantinople to Konieh is to be carried
on across the Taurus to branch off eastward
to Ragdad and Koweit, southward to Aleppo
and the Syrian system, is a military line par
excellence. Its two branches will one day aid
the German Empire to strike Britain in Asia
and Afhoa. German diplomacy in Turkey has
never ceased to keep the question of Egypt
and Arabia alive and to suggest the possi-
bility that a new Turkish army may
day inflict on Britain the stroke of Exoatibur, -
from whioh there is no recovery, cleaving in 1
twain the Empire without the slightest inter
ference on the part of the fleet on which
England’s hopes are centred.
The Tnrko-German Staff aims at nothing
less than an immediate advance on Egypt
by an overwhelming Ottoman army, should
war unhappily break out between Germany
and Great Britain after the nomplt.iy, 0f
the Ottoman strategic tines. The suooeai of
the invasion would involve the suppression of
the Mixed regime, the substitution of a dele-
gate of the Saltan for our enlightened Sovereign
and his British friends and adviiers, while the
direoting power—which wonta not
its position too strongly -» would be the
German Empire. “ Delenda est Carthago ”
and “ Unsere Zukonft tiegt am Wasaer"
have an identical meaning in Germany. Her
chief continental rival has been beaten down at
Mukden and Tsusima by her adversary’s ally,
and the Turkish. alliance. originally d—
against Russia or England may now be direoted
exclusively against the latter. Beware, England,
or the day of yonr overthrow will see this ful-
filment of the German dream and the wings of
the eagles overshadowing half the world !
Neither in the Suez Canal, which a few
merchantmen oould block to-morrow, nor in

Yes, that will be the inevitable consequence
of Britain’s Egyptian and Arabian policy,
which has earned the frown of the Shadow of
