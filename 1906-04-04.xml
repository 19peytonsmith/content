                    <p>The “unbroken series of happy and most instructive experiences,’’ as the Prince of Wales called his tour in India in his farewell speech, is, we have every reason to believe, now being repeated daring his visit to Egypt, and we are sure that the significance of the Royal visit to Cairo will long live in the memory of the people. Egyptians have been much impressed by the cordial manner in which the Khedive has been received by King Edward on his visits to England, and the present visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales testifies in an unmistakable manner to the esteem and respect in, which his Highness is held by England’s Sovereign and Heir Apparent. The gratifying marks of loyalty which the Royal victors have received throughout their tour has entailed upon them the arduous labour of incessant ceremonial and one can well imagine that their Royal Highnesses are anxious to return home as speedily as possible, espe-¬cially the Princess of Wales, whose sepa- ration for five months from her young family has, we feel sure, been a severe trial. Their stay in Cairo has therefore a peculiar significance. In view of the relations between England and Egypt, the existence of friendly <cb n="6"/>relations between the Royal family and the Ruler of this country is a political desideratum, fiat the visit wears a more personal aspect when regarded in the light of the above considerations, and bearing in mind also the duration of their stay as the guests of the Khedive, which far transcends the limit of time usual in a merely ceremonial visit Looked at from this point of view the Royal visit ought to afford exceptional gratification to the Egyptian people, as it indomitably mast to their hospitable and enlightened Viceroy. No pains or expenses have been spared to make T.R.H.’s experiences of Egypt as delightful as possible,
                        and they will no doubt carry away with them the most pleasant recollections of their stay in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Everything that tends to draw more closely the ties of friendship between England and Egypt is to be cordially welcomed, An excel- lent impression was created last year by the visit of the Duke end Duchess of Connaught to the Khedive, and the betrothal of their daughter to the son of the Crown Prince of Sweden, occurring as it did while they were the guests of his Highness, excited much pleasur-¬able feeling, which was increased by the invita¬tion given by King Edward to the Khedive to be present at the wedding of the Royal pair, his stay at Buckingham Palace, and the bestowal on his Highness of the insignia of the Victorian Order.
                        The Oriental mind always associates personality with government, end the idea of representa¬tive institutions has not yet made much ad¬vance in the East This consideration should always be borne in mind, for it emphasises the greet necessity for a good understanding to be manifest between the rulers of nations. Thus the visit of the future King and Queen of Eng¬land to the Khedive is an event that should . bear good fruit, and be very helpful in strength- ening, the “entente cordiale" that happily exists between the two countries.
                    </p><p> There can be no question that the admirable example, set by King Edward when, some¬what to the surprise of many people, he com¬menced paying a round of visits to European capitals, has had excellent results. It is a well- known fact that personal acquaintance is the very best means of bringing together people who would, in the absence of snob, be disposed to be indifferent, if not hostile, to each other. Monarchs, if exalted in position, are human, and therefore equally subject to the emotions that so greatly influence ordinary human notion. There is nothing like personal inter¬course to rob off rough edges and —in the case of rulers—help to oil the wheels of the State machine so that it may work easily and free from friction. But a state visit, with its elabo¬rate ceremonials and necessary restrictions, is not everything ; nor does it afford that oppor¬tunity of studying a country and its natives that is 'so desirable for one destined to fill a position in which such experience is, if not absolutely necessary, highly desirable. We hope, therefore, that it may be possible for the Prince and Princess of Wales before long to bring their children and winter in Egypt. A visit incog., if not conferring upon persons of their exalted rank complete freedom of notion, would at any rate be free from many of the restrictions imposed by a State visit, and we hope that it may be possible for his Highness the Khedive to secure from their Royal Highnesses a pro- mise to pay such a visit under these conditions. </p>
                    <p> Another point strikes us as worthy of mention in connection with this Royal tour.
                        It is with somewhat of a feeling of regret that we recognise the impossibility of ex-tending -it to South Africa. Many people fear that it may not be very long before there will be established there a South African Republic. Nothing in our opinion would tend more to the establishment if a South African Federation of States under the British Crown and loyal to the British Govern- ment than such a visit as that which comes to an end this week. If the visit of the Duke of Connaught, just terminated, could be followed, as in the case of Egypt, by-one from the Prince and Princess of Wales, there is no reasonable doubt that it would greatly tend to reconcile the differences of opinion now, unhappily, so marked at the other end of the African continent. Nothing succeeds like success, and the highly satisfactory results of their Royal I Highnesses’ tour in India and visit to Egypt will, we hope, bring home to the British people the conviction that it will be highly desirable to extend this system to parts of the world at present unvisited. We know of nothing more calculated than this to strengthen the bonds of Empire, or cement the friendship with countries under British influence, especially so when as is the case in Egypt, the most cordial ties of amity prevail between the Khedive and King Edward VII.

                    <p>It was mooted in Cairo last year that the Government intended erecting a huge block of buildings, to accommodate most if not all of the Ministries now at Nasrieh on the large site now occupied by the palace and grounds of the Turkish High Commissioner at Kasr-el-Nil. The Government were at the time seeking to find another suitable residence tor H.E Ghazi Mukhtar Pacha and his suite but the matter was allowed to remain in abeyance for some reason or another.
                    </p><p>The rumour is now revived that the question of building the new Ministries is about to be brought forward again. In the meanwhile there is another rumour afloat that the splendid site alluded to may eventually be chosen for the new Khedivial Opera House. If so, we know of no better position for such a building and we feel sure that such a choice would meet with general approval, far more so than erect¬ing the new Opera House of the Esbekieh Gardens, as was announced by a Cairo paper a few days ago.

Their presents and gifts to the 1'alaba are greatly appreciated. The mosque students are much encouraged thereby, and they become more diligent in learning. The Uema Board will always act so as to come up to their expectations. The Board is therefore indebted to these generous and distinguished people who support it and encourage it to push forward its schemes. It wishes to thank Mohamed Eff.

But a de¬mand for its skin has arisen in Europe and so it is being killed off to satisfy this demand and in its absence the worm increases and multiplies.

                    <p>BEDOUIN BERGASS AT GHEZIREH-</p>
                    <p>A MEMORABLE SPECTACLE.</p>
                    <p>We doubt if the grounds of the Khedivial Sporting Club were ever one-half as crowded as they were yesterday afternoon. The stream of motors, private carriages and arabiehs began to flow at 2 p.m. By 2.45 p.m. men whom Carmelite journalism would describe as wide-eyed were bailing carriages in vain and panting Berberins were informing their scowling masters that “Mafeesh arabieh abadan.” The Roulac trams were crowded and the Ghezireh ferry launch repeatedly crossed the Nile with what the naval correspondent describes as a  “pronounced list.” However, no one, to the base of our knowledge, was drowned, nor are any set-ions motor accidents reported from the Kasr el Nil Bridge.
                    </p><p>The scene in the enclosure can only be described as portentous. Three rows of chain as the railings, all occupied, were backed by yet more chairs, stools, and tables. On the roof of the Pari Mutuel sheds rows of sight¬seers braved destruction, the grand stand was crammed, the shilling enclosure fall to burst-ing point, the more or less unwashed swarmed on the outskirts of the K.S.C. grounds and up to the edge of the track, and the ease with which some members of the crowd climbed the lebbek trees in the avenue made one a convert to the theory that our ancestors led a purely arboreal life.	
                    </p><p>As for those present, their names and offices and the rest, the curious must consult the Garrison Directory passim. They were all there and so were a great number of persons whom the directories—Garrison and Rizzo's— knows not -and we hope will never know. One of these individuals is said to have knocked down four English and French ladies in trying to get out. His English betrayed the Dayo. The carriage arrangements were marked by a certain want of system, and though we acknowledge that Cairo most, suffer from possessing only one bridge, still we should hardly have thought that it was necessary to spend more than an hour in driving to or from the fantasia.
                    </p><p>Another criticism which we should like to make, refers to the sale of tickets at the entrance. In our opinion the chief hotels should have been given tickets to sell some three days before the event; the two or three clerks at the entrance did their best bat they could not cope with the crowds of buyers and a considerable block was the inevitable conse-quence. The police sent their tempers and did their best, but they did not p-event a carriage driving across the course while some of the Bedouins were galloping past, with the result that one of the tribesmen and his horse came a nasty cropper. On another occasion we hope to see rather more attention devoted to the organisation of snob meetings for without organisation it is impossible to cope with the enormous crowds that gather on such occa¬sions.
                    </p><p>The races ware ridden with the utmost vigour and dash by the Bedouins and the land- owners who competed, and those who saw them were enthusiastic. The writer, who arrived a little late was informed by one of the specta-¬tors that, he bad to for seen a camel’s head and a Bedouin’s koffieh flying past but did not despair of seeing more sooner or later. In the packed condition of the enclosure the hope seemed unduly optimistic. The camel race—4 miles—and the  “Be gass.” or trick riding of the Bedouins, were the best of the events.
                    </p><p>The "hagins” were a revelation to those who only know the Pyramid camel and his brother who carries loads over the Kasr el Nil bridge, provoke* profanity among arbagis, and in spring when "the vernal impulsion makes lyrical all that hath language” grants and sometimes tries to bite. It was won by the Moteye Bedouins from above Assiont, whose winning “hagin” arrived at Cairo on Sunday night after doing 300 miles over the desert in four days. All good sportsmen will be delighted that his owner, Selim Tawil, had the satisfaction of winning and winning from capital competitors, after so remarkable a feat. To accomplish a fine long distance performance between Wednesday and Sunday night and to win the - 4 miles race by half a length or a neck and half a hump —does credit to owner, rider, and camel alike.
                    </p><p>The “Bergass” after the races was well worth seeing, and about a fifth of those present saw it. The ride’s and their horses were worthy of the occasion and the music played by the lutes and arghools and drums give one a better opinion of the Bedouin than the Egypt-ian ear. The horses—in splendid trappings— and whose riders knew their work thoroughly, swayed and curvetted, dropped on their knees, wheel-turned before the Royal box where T.R.H the Prince and Princess of Wales and H H. the Khedive watched the riders with undisguised interest. At the end came a pro¬cession of horsemen and cameleers closed by two camels bearing huge red covered letters on their backs.
                    </p><p>At about 5.45 p.m the Royal guests left with their escort of the Body Guard and were followed by H.H. the Khedive. Loud cheers greeted them on their departure as on their arrival, and the Bedouins let off their long guns with cheerful abandon. Then the multitude made tracks tor the bridge or despatched shouting boys in search of undiscoverable arabiebs.
                    </p><p>(FROM OUR LADY CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>For those who were able to see them the afternoon’s proceedings most have been full of wild excitement, but as two-fifths of the onlook <cb n="4"/> ers never got a chance of viewing anything beyond the dense crowd of people standing on tea tables the zest of the afternoon was not altogether general. At times the wild thud o' horse’s hoofs told of a violent scurry, at others the bobbing heads of Bedouin riders seen even above the heads of the onlookers betokened that a camel race was in progress, but otherwise the afternoon was without violent interest to the above mentioned fraction of that mighty crowd that blocked up every inch of available space, that packed the grandstand, that perched upon the railings, tint swarmed upon the roofs, and that even clambered up into the trees and hung like huge insects from the branches.
                       </p><p>Things were easier when a stream of people were allowed to cross the course and take up their position along the rails, though even then the motley members of the crowd did their best to spoil the view for anyone hot themsel¬ves. We English are a fairly law-abiding people, and it is annoying on such occasions to find that our natural instincts to keep within our borders result in oar being shoved violently in the rear by a badly-mannered crowd. The police did their best, it is true, but somehow fair best was not much to the point, and we be surprised if we do not hear more complaints against the - arrangements, which were entirely inadequate to the occasion.
                        </p><p>When one did get an opportunity of seeing anything that was in progress on the course one understood why this "bergass’’ attracted such enormous crowds. The magnificent horses were worth going miles to see, and caparisoned as they were, and with their Bedouin riders on their backs. they carried one away to wild tales of daring do in the desert. While not engaged in races or fantasias before the Royal box they were curvetting about the tents of encamp- ments, and there also triumphant camels were showing off their paces before an admiring crowd. The fantasias already mentioned were thoroughly barbaric and unexpected. The native music made weird noises, the horse* pranced and stamped and flung themselves to and fro, while their riders swung naked scimi- tars and lances round their heads and grew more and more daring with the applause that greeted their achievements.
                       </p><p>It was all a very wonderful sight and had we better opportunities of witnessing the rest of the proceedings we could be in a better position to describe the operations. No better fantasia could have been devised for the enter¬tainment of our rural visitors. They, at any rate, had a good view of everything, and it is to be hoped that they did not suffer from the incon-venience that dogged the steps of the less mighty. No pen can write of individual in that huge assemblage, everybody who is any¬body and all the m bodies as well were present, and every arabeh in all the length and breadth of Cairo was waiting outside the gates.
                       </p><p>Yesterday morning the Prince of Wales went out of El Avat for quail. His Royal Highness who was accompanied by Mr Allan Joseph and Mr. Fischer, enjoyed very fair sport daring the limited time at his disposal, ret- urning it about 12.30 p.m.

                <p>PETITION TO PRINCE OF WALES.</p>
                <p>WANTED A CONSTITUTION.</p>
                <p>A significant petition has been presented to the Prince of Wales by Sheikh Tewfik el Bakri, who holds the position of Nakibiel- Ashraf or the official head of the native aristocracy. It runs as follows :—
                </p><p>The Egyptians are exceeding glad at the visit of the Crown Prince of the most power¬ful kingdom in the world, a kingdom firmly established on a constitutional basis, on the liberty of the subject, and the rights of the people. This Power has held our land tor twenty-three years in order to advance it by all possible means in the way of progress and afterwards to hand back Egypt to her own people to be governed by them.
                </p><p>The Egyptians were greatly pleased when your Royal Highness deigned to grant an audience to the members of the Legislative Council, whom you graciously called the re-presentatives of the nation. The people of Egypt are delighted, and hope that that inter¬view will hereafter be remembered when the day comes for the members of that Council to be the real representatives of the nation. The Egyptians, Sire, are most grateful. and both in private and in public acknowledge the great and substantial progress that has been made by the help of the clever English engineers and some of the officials of the Occupation. But before the days of the Occupation the nation had a fundamental system of government. A constitution and a Legislative Council were formed when Egypt was occupied with a view to transforming it into a parliamentary council in accordance with the promises of Lord Dufferin. The Egyptians still bear in mind their old privi¬leges and always remember the words of Lord Dufferin, and hope and trust that one day those words will come true. You. Sire, have called the notables of the Council "represen¬tatives of the nation.” The need of a Con¬stitution is recalled to our minds by this term, and the Egyptians hope that your visit will, in the near future, result in bringing about the making of a Constitution for Egypt. Two years ago the General Assembly addressed such it demand to the Khedivial Government, and the members of the Legis¬lative Council are also members of the As-¬sembly We shall also remember the speech which your illustrious father made not long ago on the constitution. In King Edward’s speech to the Parliament he declared. "Those countries that have been granted constitutions by the British Government have all become prosperous and contented. This policy has led to friendly tips between these lands and Great Britain.” Therefore we beg of your , Royal Highness that the outcome of your visit will be to remind the British Govern-ment to fulfill the promise that was once made to us. Therefore your visit will never be forgotten by the people of the land of Egypt.

                    <p>THE FRONTIER QUESTION.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday last in the House of Commons, Sir W. Lawson (L. Cockermouth) asked the Secretary for Foreign Affairs whether there WHS any truth in the report published on Monday morning that, failing an agreement between the British and Turkish Governments with regard to the occupation of Tabah, on the Egyptian frontier, the position would be bom¬barded by British warships, and whether the 1 Egyptian Government had ever exercised authority over Tabah. (Hear, hear.)
                    </p><p>Sir E. Grey—I should like to take the oppor- tunity of my honourable friend’s question to dispel some of the approbation which has been aroused by mis-statements in some quar¬ters. No ultimatum has been sent to the Turkish Government, and no question has been raised as to Akaba. which is in Turkish territory. Tabah, on the contrary, is in the Sinai Penin¬sula, which for several generations has been recognised as being under the administration of Egypt; Tabah and one or two other posts in the Sinai Peninsula have quite recently been occupied by Turkish troops ; it is obvious that this aggression upon Egyptian administra- tion cannot be allowed to continue, but the question is now the subject of negotiation.
                    </p><p>(Hear, hear.)</p>
                    <p>TYPHOID AT AKABA.</p>
                    <p>According to a report published by the
                    Mokastam, the Turkish troops at Akaba are
                    suffering severely from typhoid, which is said
                    to have greatly reduced their effective strength.</p>
                    <p>THE ARABIAN VILAYETS.</p>
                    <p>There has recently taken , place in the Mabein of Yildiz a change which is of moment in view of the present frontier imbroglio, in that it will introduce a new element—the Turkish — into the administration of the Arabian provinces. Up till now Izzet Pacha, Second Secretary of the Sultan, who is an Arabian, has filled all the best posts on the peninsula with his proteges. We now learn that the Government party that is, the Sublime Porte, headed by Ferid Pasha, is in the ascendant, so that Izzet Pacha will no longer be able to dispose of the Sultan’s dominions as he' listeth. With an Albanian Vizier at the head of affairs, a martial im-petus must be expected in the near future to Turkey’s Arabian policy via the Hedjaz Railway.
                    </p><p>Five battalions have, we hear, reached Akaba and a huge barracks is being built for their accommodation.

                    <p>THE KAISER AS A WITNESS.</p>
                    <p>SENSATIONAL LIBEL CASE PENDING.</p>
                    <p>A sensational libel case arising out of alleged illegal arrest in Egypt is expected to shortly come before the German Courts, and according to a report which is attracting much attention in Berlin, the Kaiser is expected to appear as a witness.
                    </p><p>Fran Mileski, lady-in-waiting in attendance on Princess Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein, is suing Prince Ernest Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein, and the Court Chamberlain, for damages for illegal arrest in this country.
                    </p><p>A charge of theft was brought against her, but could not be substantiated. Herr Blumen-thal, the Chamberlain, requested the Egyptian Government to effect the arrest, stating that the Kaiser himself desired this to be done.
                    </p><p>Should the report prove correct, the follow¬ing remarkable list of witnesses will give evidence :—The Kaiser, the Kaiserin, Princess Frederick Leopold of Prussia, the Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein, and many other notabilities.
                    </p><p>The Emperor himself ordered Fran Mileski to demand compensation.</p>

                    <p>Since yesterday afternoon up to about 12 o’clock noon to-day the body of an unknown native has been dashed about by a merciless sea in the eastern harbour of Alexandria, without, to our knowledge, any effort being made to rescue it How the man was drowned is as yet a mystery, but crowds of spectators have stood on the sea-wall yesterday and this morning watching the body being tossed about by the waves, even against the seawall itself. None of the spectators evi-dently dared to make any effort at rescue owing to the high sea that was running, but surely some steps should have been taken by the auth-rities to put an end to such a disgraceful scene. The official excuse vouchsafed to our reporter at the Gonvernorat this morning for the body remaining in the water so long was that the rough sea precluded any attempts at rescue, but that it was hoped the body would be ultimately washed ashore by the waves ! ! Comment is needless.
                    </p><p>Just as we are going to press we are glad to learn that the body of the drowned man has been rescued by a Coast Guard boat. We are assured that owing to the rough state of the sea it was impossible to effect this before.

                <div type="item"><head>SIR NICHOLAS O’CONOR.</head>
                    <p>Sir Nicholas O’Conor, our Ambassador at Constantinople, who is having some trouble with the Sultan at present over the occupa¬tion of Tabah, in Egyptian territory by Turkish troops, has had eight years of service now in that most difficult of Embassies. He succeeded Lord Currie just after the recrudescence of the Armenian massacres that sent a fresh shudder A through civilised Europe, and when the indig¬nation which these Turkish outrages evoked had made the Sultan even more difficult to get on with than usual.
                    </p><p>But Sir Nicholas is a clever Irishman, with nearly forty years of diplomatic experience behind him, who has represented England in half a dozen great countries and one or two little dues, and during his stay at Constantino-ple he has contrived to maintain on the whole notably smooth relations with Abdul Hamid II. Lord Salisbury sent Sir Nicholas to St. Petersburg to attend the Coronation of the present Czar, while before that he was British Minister at Pekin, which he left just in time to avoid the Boxer disturbances which afterwards broke out there, and the massacre of Europeans which did not take place.

                    <p>LONDON, April 8.</p>
                    <p>HOUSE OF COMMONS. - On the motion of Mr. MacDonald, Labourite, drawing attention to the danger in which native subjects of the Crown may be involved owing to the adminis-tration of martial law in Natal, Mr. Churchill declared that the Imperial Government’s whole course had been correct, consistent, and una¬voidable. The precipitate resignation of the Natal Ministry was not altogether consistent with their passionate appeals for the support of British troops. Mr. Churchill arouesed the opposition of endeavouring to poison the minds of the colonists. If this course were pursued in, they would easily produce effects shaking ( the whole system of colonial administration to its foundations.	(Reuter)

                    <p>THE WADI RAYAN CLAIM.</p>
                    <p>The “Brooklyn Eagle” remarks : —</p>
                    <p>Every admirer of American energy and grit will rejoice at the news that came from Washington yesterday to the effect that the Department of State has at last secured a reconsideration by the Egyptian Government of the claim of P. Cope Whitehouse, an Ame¬rican, who ten years ago discovered the dry site of Lake Moeris in a great depression in the Lybian desert to the southwest of the Fayoum. The Fayoum is the most fertile spot in Egypt south of the Delta, and is about four hours ride from Cairo, by rail to a station, whence the rest of the day’s trip is made on camel or mule back.
                    </p><p>There is little doubt that Lord Milner was the stumbling block in the way of White- house’s getting his rights. He located the site of this ancient reservoir and obtained a concession from the Khedivial Government to form a company and to open a canal to the Nile banks which, when the river ran aflood, would fill the depression, 225 square miles in extent, and thus form an oasis of vast area. Upon the shores of this artificial lake, White- house expected to plant sugar cane, to erect mills for crushing the cane, vats for boiling the syrup and refineries for making sugar. If he had secured his concession before the Assouan dam was built he would have became a very rich man. Now, I fear. the people who tend the sluice gates of the red granite dam at the First Cataract will not allow enough water to flow through to lift the river’s surface to a height sufficient to fill Mr. Whitehouse’s lake. The Nile flood does not extend beyond Assouan any more.
                    </p><p>When I was in Egypt I remember that Lord Milner said: “Mr. Whitehouse is an enthusiast, not to say a fanatic, for his Wadi-Rayan scheme. Still, it is impossible not to feel admiration for a man who devotes his whole life and his remarkable abilities to the advocacy of a great work of public utility. The reservoir that Mr. Whitehouse recom- mends may not be the best reservoir, but there are strong prima-facie arguments in its favour. His opinions deserve the most careful consideration.” This was said of Whitehouse by the man who is really responsible for the Assouan dam (which, by the Way, I travelled 600 miles to see, and over which Chief Engineer John Blue conducted me).
                    </p><p>Now that this $10,000,000 experiment at Assouan has proved an utter failure, so far as increasing the extent of agricultural land, the Egyptian Government will take up Mr. Whitehouse’s practical suggestion and prob¬ably confirm his concessions which have been “held up’’ in true brigand fashion. The English contractors, who, under Lord Cromer, British consul-general, built the utterly useless Assouan dam and saddled the expense upon the poor fell heen of the Nile Valley are apt to permit Mr. Whitehouse and his friends to carry out at least part of their plans, because he doesn’t ask a piastre from the Egyptians. That canal will be built with American money, as a private enterprise.

                <div type="item"> <head>HAREM LIFE.</head>
                    <p>Pierre Loti has resolved to put to shame the idleness of M. Paul Bourget and the rest, and gives us the first part of his ”Les De en-chantes,” which deals (so far) with the life of a Turkish harem. He warns us in his preface that we are not to see in his characters any real or living people, else we might possibly consider it is Captain Viand who is shown to us under the name of Andre Lhery, the famous novelist, who receives in his Breton home a letter in four pages from a Turkish lady on the
                    eve of her marriage to a husband whom, according to etiquette, she has never seen. The next chapter transports us to a Stamboul harem, where there are neither odalisques nor intrigues, but where three Circassian maidens, speaking French, German, Dalian, and English with equal ease, dressed in Parisian “creations" and reading Verlaine, Baudelaire, Byron, and Shakespeare, a charming mixture this—sob themselves to sleep the night before the bridal of the writer of the letter with a handsome young Bey. Pierre Lori tells us that this is the way with all Constantinople gyucuea at the present day, and that the inmates of these gilded cages, having tasted of the fruit of Western knowledge, regret most bitterly the being handed over like cattle to husbands whom they have not chosen. How the story will develop, one cannot say; but as the only other female characters in it are a negro maid servant and a stern grandmother, it is difficult at present to say who is going to be disen-chanted as the result of the marriage. As to the knowledge that the novelist displays of what goes on in Eastern dimes behind the purdah, one cannot help repeating the comment of William III. when told that the fighting Bishop of Derry had been killed at the fording of the Boyne:  “What did he there ?”

                   <p>A LUCKY BUS DRIVER.</p> 
                    <p>In all the accounts which have appeared in these columns upon the Nelson Memorandum, from its discovery to its sale at Christie’s for £3,600 on March 14, it has been stated that the owner did not desire his name to be disclosed but preferred “to be left in peace.” But his joy has been too great. His friends know. And his friends—brave fellows—are ‘bus conductors, for the lucky man is a 'bus driver. The other day says the “Daily Telegraph,” a well-known medical man in the suburbs happened to be in a local ‘bus. The conductor thereof had the eloquence of his class, and from summary ob¬servations on the weather leapt straight to the remark, “Some men are lucky.” Forthwith he reeled off his illustration. “A fine thing happen¬ed the other day for one of our drivers, good old Will—You must know him, sir. He’s the man what owned that memorandum all the papers has been writing about. Now he’s got a matter of £3,000 odd in his kick for a blooming old piece of a paper. It seems as how Will was driving one day, and a gent, on the front seat, affable-like, asks Will if he’d ever been to Merton Abbey, where Nelson used to live. ‘Nelson,’ says Will. ‘I know something about him,’‘What?’ says the gent. ’Well it’s like this,’ says Will. My father was an old sailor, and when he gave up the sea was an admiral’s man. The old admiral liked him, and gave him an old desk with some letters in it, and one I know bears on Trafalgar.’ Presently the gent  says, ‘If you show me that and I like it. I’ll give yon £10 and a suit of clothes for it.’ Will said he’d see, but he asked another gent, next day about it, and he said, ‘send it to Christie,  Manson and Woods ’ And Will has got a nice little pile now.” “Is he not going to retire ?”. inquired the medical man. “No fear. He’s still driving his ’bus. What he's made is his nest- 
                    egg"	</p>
                    <p>The 'bus-man told the story while guiding his horses along his usual route.
                    </p><p>“My friends,” he said, “are making far too much fuss about this business. I want to be left in peace, and I have reasons for not wishing my name to be mentioned. Of course, I’m glad that the paper fetched so much, and I only wish my poor father were alive to share the money. Ha was for many years butler to Sir George Mundy who was a friend of Nelson. Sir George was paralysed on one side, and when he gave my father the old desk, containing the papers, he made him promise to stay with him as long as he lived. Sir George's home was at the end of Grosvenor place, and when a child I remember seeing from his drawing room win-dow Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort come riding out from Buckingham Palace.
                    </p><p>"Before he died, in 1884 my father hand¬ed me the desk, saying that the papers might be valuable to me some time. Among them was an autograph letter of Nelson’s, but I’m “Sorry to say I parted with that. I do not believe anyone besides my father, my daughter, and myself had seen the Memo-randum for thirty years before I took it to Messrs, Christie. No one but myself had anything to do with the transaction - even my family didn’t, know of it until a few days ago.	I
                    </p><p>“No, I haven’t yet got the money. It is all a right in Messrs. Christie's hands. By and by I shall look round for some good investments. I have had enough worry in my time. Some years ago I had a coaching business on the South Coast, but with electric trams and motor-cars there is not much coaching to be done nowadays. At sixty one doesn’t care to take fresh risks.
                    </p><p>"So I think I shall stick to my ’bus. I have been driving for several years, and never felt better in my life. My children are all grown up and doing well. I once thought of joining my son who is in New Zealand but there is no need to think of that now. I like my work, and I can have a day or two off when I want to. Yes, with this money behind me I shall be able to enjoy myself very well. But I’m not worrying about it, and I only a want to be left in peace.”

                    <p>The cotton from Egyptian sped in Mozambi¬que is doing well. Messrs. Wolsteholme and Holland, the brokers of the British Cotton- Growing Association, have just sold at Liverpool 144 bales of cotton grown by the Mozam-bique Company at her plantation at Chirinds, in the province of Chiloane at the very satisfactory price of 9d. per lb. Messrs. Wolsten-holme and Holland report that “this cotton has more nature in it than the bulk of the pro¬duce from Egyptian seed grown in other parts ' of Central or East Africa, and there is a great - future before it, if proper care is taken with  the selection of seed, cultivation. &amp;c.” There would thus seem to be grounds for hoping that he territory of the Mozambique Company may become a valuable auxiliary in freeing the cotton-spinners of Lancashire from their present dependence on American growers.

                <p>The construction of the Ethel Pain Me-morial Hospital at Cairo is progressing. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Algernon Coote a year ago. Originally the plans extend-ed only to the building of a ground floor at an estimated cost of £2,300. Shortly afterwards, before the foundation-stone was laid, as further subscriptions amounting to over £1,000 had been unexpectedly received, the addition of a "first floor" was decided, thus bringing the estimated cost to £3,200. All through last year donations were sent from many parts of that amount subscribed has now reached £3,293, including about £100 spe-cially given for equipment. It has been found that the estimate has been exceeded by about £300, the total cost of the building, exclusive of equipment, being about £3,500. It was not possible at the outset to estimate exactly, so much depended upon the nature of the soil and the consequent depth necessary for foundations. Not less than £1,000 has been spent upon the foundation, and no small addition to the estimate was occasioned by the necessity for the removal of some exceedingly tough Roman masonry which was found extending right across the site, about eight feet down. Disappointing as it is to find that the cost of the building has con-siderably exceeded the amount subscribed, it is consoling to realize that the excess has not been due to errors needing rectifying, and that the building which has cost £3,500 could not now be rebuilt for less than £5,000, so extraordi-nary has been the rise in price of labour and material during the year owing to the unprece-dented number of speculative enterprises that have sprung up of late. In fact, there can be small doubt that the price at which the con-tract was accepted has left but little margin for the the contractor who has had to face the rapidly rising prices.  </p>
                <p>The 'Memorial Brass', which has arrived from London, beautifully executed in red and black lettering, will be placed on the wall of the corridor on the ground floor. It reads as follows:-</p><p>To the Glory of God</p><p>And the loved memory of</p><p>Ethel Blanche Pain</p><p>Who came from Sydney, Australia, to Egypt</p><p>April 15th, 1902,</p><p>And entered into her rest, December 8th, 1903</p><p>This hospital</p><p>Erected for the woman and children whom she loved</p><p>and for whom she spent her brief life here</p><p>Is dedicated</p><p>In deep love and thankfulness</p><p>'Love never faileth'</p></div>

Un-fortunately, though what I take to have been a printer's error, your kind intention in pub-lishing was partially defeated. The paragraph stated that Miss Van Sommer had purchased the site and built thereon a Home (I quote from memory) whereas as a matter of fact, the work is just being commenced. I have not yet heard whether the foundations are in, and being one of Miss Van Sommer's trustees I know that she has not yet received sufficiente money to adequately complete the work.</p></div>

                    <p>What is all malt whisky and what is grain whisky? A 1 malt whisky is made entirely of malted barley distilled in the old fashioned pot still. Grain whisky is made from a mixture of 15 to 35 per cent malted barley and the remainder unmalted oats, rye, maize, and bar¬ley distilled in a patent coffey still. To enable the reader to understand the exact position, and find out what suits his constitution best, we give an extract from an editorial in the “Edin¬burgh Medical Journal,” December, 1903, page 482 “Most pure malt whiskies contain too large a proportion of volatile ethers to be easily digested and assimilated, while mixed with a small proportion of very old grain spirit, they are rendered not only more palatable, but also more suitable for a weak stomach Accordingly, though on theory the physician would be right in saying that a spirit which contains a large number of volatile ethers would be the best as a cardiac or lung stimu¬lant, yet he would have to remember that such a stimulant in its pure state is not easily borne except by the strongest of stomachs, and re¬quires a proportion of old grain spirit, which chemically is much purer owing to the high distillation which it undergoes. Finally let it be repeated that the primary requisites of all whiskies are age and absence of adulteration.” Such a whisky is exactly represented by Mackie’s White Horse. 10 Years Old. [Advt.]
