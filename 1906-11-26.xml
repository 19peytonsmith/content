He recalls the fact that the arrangement lietveen thu Anatolian Railway and the Ottoman Ooseramcnt, which is the charter of the futuic line, places it under a purely Qertnan hegemony The German campaign carried on with the object of wearing the inue in Frauen in May. I9<l3,cf Hveral hundred million fnuira' worth of share» io the Baghdad Railway had to he abandoned owing to the interetmtion of the French Government, which^af tor a diwreet exchange of views between London and Paria, rweognixad the enormoua importance of the question 11 Cheradame adds that the syndic ate intercated in the ache me iacludrw French Cun tractors and financier* Hu, however, warns Frenchmen who may think of inventing in tbu line that it cannot pay for at least ten or fifteen yea.» after ■ ■ completion. Thia would norma rily lead to a temporary depreciation of their ■barm sufficient to cause French holders to re-eell them to the Germans, "who would thus do an e » cel lent stroke of business financially after succeeding m an admirable political operation' He further gives his mains for believing that Turkey will nevrr be able to pay a kilometric guarantee an a line of such great length Heasks whether France shoo Id open her market to an enterprise which in existing conditions would expeae French i lives tom to serin os Inu. Further, shool.l she facilitate an enterprise tending to confine the absorption of Asia Minor by the Grr mans and their Commercial aud pnhuctl penetration in the Balkan* and Croirai Europe 1 The question of the Baghdad Hail ■ ay is, he contends, of the grmtewl political important, unt only for Europe, hut for the whole world, since its realisation in existing circumatancea would be equivalent to the ex tendon nf German political and economic indnence from Hamburg to the Ptrxian Gulf.
                
                Belting aside all idea of systematic oppni-Iinn to the principle of the Baghdad Rsilw.v M. Cheradame maintains that them is still tim-to try to prevent it from remaining prvd’ minaiitly German.

The fleet at present consists of the Lefkosia (1,400 tons, 11 knots), the Cypros (2,21 0 tons, 10 knots), and the Salamis (1,500 tons, 15 knots.) The last vessel was purchased only six weeks ago from the Aberdeen Line and used to ran between Aberdeen and London. Tho company has a regular weekly departnre on Tnoedays from Alexandria and on Fridays and Wednesdays in alternate weeks respectively from Limassol. All the steamers tonoh at Port Said. The Salamis and Lefkosia are lor the passenger service, while Ihe Cyprus is far oargo ; all these boats are British made, having been purchased io England. The company is contemplating buying another passeoger steamer of 4,000 tons io England, and will from time to time make farther additions to their fleet as the trade develops.
                    
                    Tbe greater part of the trade between Egypt and Cyprus will, the oompany believe, fall into its hands, as the local Greek traders in Egypt and Cypras, who are interested in the trade between the two ooontries, are shareholders. The Government ol Cypros give nnml subvention of £5,000 to the oom-
                    
                    pany for carrying the mails.
                    
                    Among the projects of the company is one for starting a subsidiary Hotel Treat which develop the hotel facilities thronghont
                    
                    Cypres and by building up-to-date hotels on Mount Troodos and in other resorts in that beantitnl island, will attraot tourists thither.
                    
                    The “At Home" on Saturday was a brilliant fnnoticn, and the Salamis had been lavishly prepared for the oooasicn. A plenteous buffet occupied the greater part of the saloon and a fine string band played a delightful seleotion of music. Among the many well-known persons present were Mustapha Pasha Ibadi, Governor of Alexandria, who was accompanied by his secretary,Beneducci Bey; M. Sootidis, Hellenio Consol Qoneral at Alexandria ; Mr. Grieg. H B.M.'s Vice-Consnl at Alexandria; Mr. Salvago, Mr. Delta, and many leading members of the Greek and other Buropean Colonies. Mr. Frangonlis, the advocate, delivered a most eloquent speech on tbe occasion and tbe success of the Company waa toasted by all present

                        ‘FROU FROU-'
                        ■'Fron Proa" is Ihe story of a frivolous, careless woman who brings uohappinesa on herself and all hers. She diss—on the stage—at the end. There we had what Jane Hadiog has not given before. She was as great as ever, moviûg ne all; many people oonld not help showing it, and I think every one felt it The vcice, that wonderful voice, so faint, sorrowful, all hat lifelesw, loving and lorgetting all the harm she had done and •uflorod : ' Mon fil», mon fil»." After hetring her it ia hard even to write the words She waa delightfully amnaing in tbe rehearsal scene of the seoood act, and aa wonderful as ever in tho scene where sha implores Sariorys not to fight M. Arnaud had less to do than nsnal, and the others hardly rose to the ooca^jon, though at one moment M. Grammont waa really good. M. Garat (Sarto-rya) was perhaps bettor than nsnal, but he always jnst falls short somehow of a real effort. He and Graunmont (aa Brigard) in the death soene were not at all good. The convention waa badly marked and tbe effect nearly spoiled ; it would have been quite spoiled, had we not ind ali been enchained ty "Frou Fron" herself. Yet it was percsptible all through that
                        
                        she waa not giving tbe whole of herself to os. Probably the company are not sufficiently near her ; and then the audience : One does not wish to be always abusing one's fallow listeners, bnt oh that every one could be traioed to be quiet and restrained in a theatre ' Coogbs, trampling, whispers, rnstiing, and almost always at the wrong miirrfnts, all these are nothing less than exs'ponRing, and yet it is so es ay to avoid them. It seems to bo simply carelessness and lack of real attention to the play, that very lack of attention whioh the players evidently feel at once, and resent by overacting, -underacting, or even laughing at their audience. Wbat wonder ! And why trouble to do one’s best to a house that is not really attentive or oritical I Lonise (Mile Soreao) was good, distinctly better than I have seen her so far. Bnt the whole performance was on a lower level than 'Sapho," except for Jane Hadirg herself.

At least one conld Bee how most of the audience resented tbe untimely and inoessant interruptions Sone of the most culpable and careless offenders were even in boxes.

                            The "M»ltre do Forges" has a tonoh of Ibe ‘sixties, of mnoh advertised melodrama. Some ilegioos people might call it a g'orified adman" or whatever Mr. Caine's plsy ia ed. Happily, it has homuor, and real depth, bus it ia not one ot the great and subtle masterpieces. The high moral sentiments, the sublime dnel verging on the ridinnlons (and how these incidents appealed ') are only jnst saved by certain passages : one, notably, relieves the whole piece, the conversation of the Duke wilh Moulinet (it was the one situation where MM. Ragonean and Hanterive really shone). "Il est devenn prefet ;" "encore an qui est mal tourné," is worthy of any author. Mile Snrean and M. Arnaud were unusually excellent. M. Arnaud's immobility suppressed passion iai-ed him above himself. He waa for a time not merely the well-trained, olever man of the world ; he was very nearly great And Mile Screen's mannerisms and aoeentnationa for onoe had their full effect The others were good after their kind.

She did exaggerate so far as so great an artiste can do so, bnt every instant was crowded with emotion. Those wonderful eyes, that voioe, the hands : s a history lor whosoever has felt and

In a word, it may not he her subtlest or most moving impersonation that the nature of Ihe play forbids ; but one almost thinks it the most wonderful. One is odoced to vaine it the more in that though she had moments of convention, glances, and deep tones of Sarah Bernhardt, silences when the lipe only formed the words—that is imposed, hardly natural—yet she redeems that play whioh ia pore convention relieved by occasional brilliancy—that brilliancy which

                            Having, under Mme Hadiog's auspices, gone through an exhaustive study of tho eternal triangle in all its aspects, it is something of a rebel to turn to so admirables drama as Sudermann's "Stein unter Steinen,"—to turn, that is to say, from romsnee to reality. For it is reality, or rather realism, that forms the essence of the play. It contains, properly speaking, only one problem, bnt one which ‘ gives furiously to think," namely the question whether Zarncke, in employing discharged conviot», ia right ia appealing to what little bononr they may cr may not have hy placing them in positions of trost, and snffsring accordingly. For tbe rest the drama atonnda in unique pictures of human nature. Take any one of tbe men or women whom Snder-mann so excellently portrays. No sooner are we introduced to them than we can tell a1mo>t to a certainty what lies btlore them ; no character is nntrne to itself; each pursues its coarse unswervingly. For instance, in Aot III., the stone-masons, accustomed to Biegler's oower ing demeanour, are astounded at his sadden outbreak, but we are not : crashed though he be by his five years' sentence lor manslaoghter, we have seen sufficient of him to know that he will be unable to endure Giittliogk'a insolence, Nur should it surprise us that Gottlingk, being thwarted, will seek his revenge, that Lore will at length abandon hope cf marriage wilh him, the father of her child, that Marie will eventu. ally yield to his allurements, that Strove, the philosophic old gaol bird, will betray tbe trost placed iu him, that, finally, Biegler, whose disinterested motives reoall Bernard Shaw's "Devil's Disciple," will at last overcome the scruples of his fsllnw-worlcmen and chase away the shadows which haunt his past There was never a more consistent play and seldom a better constrooted one. Each character speaks and behaves exaotly aa might be expected nnder tbe circumstances, and thus the dramatic situations seldom take ns unawares. But ever fresh matter for serions thought is afforded as well as admiration for the skill wilh which the plot is unfolded. There was one slight jarring note, when Sudermann carries his realism a little too fir : Biegler, after his violent scene with Gottlingk, return» to finish bis glass of beer. Now, no donbt, yonr loyal German will as toon think of leaving bis beer untouched as of openly abusing the Kaiser or of sitting in a drafty room ; yet Biegler's action rankled.
                            
                            As regard» the production of this play, on Satnrday, by Sig. G. Novelli's Italian company, we will only say that, although all did their best, the acting on tho whole was below'he standard required. Signori Novelli, Tettoni, and 8pinelli, respectively,as Biegler,Gh'tlingk, and Strove, did well enough. Sig. Greco's Zarncke was too stagay, but Siga. Vidali made a creditable Lore.
                            
                            Any pleasure the play might have afforded us was entirely spoilt by the persistence of tbe prompter to make his tinny, rançons voioe carry not only to the aotors bnt over the whole theatre, despite tbe effort, of the audience and of Sig. Novelli himself to repress him. Otherwise tbe play was well reoeived.
