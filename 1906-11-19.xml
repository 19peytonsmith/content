Meanwhile an argent appeal is made for more capital.
                
                The accounts for the work in Lagos show a profit of £9.489 4 a. 5J., this being equal, after the payment of all expenses, including depto-oiation and a proportion of the home expenditure, to a net surplos of £305 10«. 9d. It is hoped that next year Northern Nigeria and the Gold Coast will also prove a son roe of inoome.
